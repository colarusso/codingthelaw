"[CA] When does this become extortion/blackmail?. I had an inappropriate online relationship with a woman that was engaged/married. Suffice to say, there is a stash of very damaging information on her.
I understand that if I threaten to turn over this information to her husband unless she gives me something in return, that's extortion, and illegal.

Is my ex extorting me over mediation?!. I'm in Colorado. My ex and I have a parenting plan in place for my son that says I will claim him on taxes since my ex only has him on weekends. This was placed in 2011. Now all the sudden he would like to start claiming him on his taxes for the child tax credit. I said no and at first he said we need to go to mediation. Tonight I received a text from him saying I need to sign the document to allow him to claim my son on his taxes and if I choose to go to mediation he will tell the courts I'm committing fraud (which is bullshit).

Go to court. Hopefully be reinstated. Then comply with all probation rules and complete it. Any advice on to go about that? He has a lawyer who offered a flat rate of 2,000 for help.

"[Australia] Opening a Sportsbook. Hi Legaladvice,

I've been doing some research into this topic and I have been unable to find much helpful advice, I was hoping you guys would be able to help! 

The general premise is that I would like to create an online sportsbook that does not deal with or handle a fiat currency in any way. The items used to bet however can be obtained by a fiat currency through alternative exchanges. We would distribute these items ourselves to the exchanges.  

Given gambling is a rather heavily regulated industry, I was wondering where we would need to register a business and what we would need to watch out for.",0
"KY -- I hit someone else's empty boat trailer with my empty boat trailer, does my insurance cover it?. The person whose trailer I hit wasn't present, but I left a note.  I'm trying to figure out whether it would be my boat insurance or Auto insurance?  I'm assuming auto, since the neither boat was present at the time.  Will my auto insurance cover damages to their trailer? (I have full coverage) and will I pay a deductible for that?  Its about $2400 in damages, and I'd rather not tell my insurance company and have my rates go up if I end up having to pay $1000 for the deductible when I can try to scrape up the money for the full amount.",0
"Legality behind creating a service which 'wraps' another service, skimming off the price difference?. Say I created a transcription service, where people payed me to transcribe their audio. Instead of hire people to do it 'myself', i just passed the audio files on to other companies who costed less, and took the price difference.

This *seems* like it should be wrong, but also seems like it'd be awkward to make laws for (outsourcing to 3rd party companies might be part of the process, like how sliced bread manufacturers don't grow their own wheat).

What would be the 'official verdict' behind this, or is it more of a grey area?

Thanks!",0

It was exactly 250 and the arresting officer ""added"" additional damages to get a felony arrest so it was originally vandalism over 500.  I didn't realize until I got my background check that it is incorrect and has been on my record this entire time.  So that makes me think the amount that I paid my probation was incorrect as well.

"Ebay Copyright Help. I have recently been listing Kodi firesticks on Ebay. These devices have just contained Kodi and no additional add-ons that would allow people to access copyrighted material, so are completely legal. Ebay has decided to remove this product. When I asked them for what reason they removed my product: they first told me I was allowing people to access copyrighted material. So I told them this wasn't true and people would have to modify the device to put add-ons on Kodi. They then told me it was removed because of hidden guidelines they have which prohibit Kodi devices. Are eBay allowed to do this? Is it even likely these hidden guidelines exist? Is there anything I could really do?",0
"Question about getting married twice (to the same person in different countries) (Canada; Quebec; UK). I'm a Canadian citizen studying in the UK.

"SSI assets include car?. Hey so I was planning on buying my cousin's 2013 Honda Fit, KBB value around $7000 for getting to work and college. Me and my mom live in NJ and she receives SSI, food stamps, Medicare, and we're living on public property. So I've seen mixed messages online that if I buy the car the value might be treated as an asset and can reduce our benefits. These programs have a asset limit, but I've seen some stuff saying that cars don't count towards these assets. I don't want my mom to lose healthcare or any income benefits as she's disabled and money's tight. The only reason I could afford this Fit is my cousin letting me pay the money over time.

"Concerned father is getting wrapped up in foreign romance scam. Hello,

I (28,m) live with my father in the US (CO)   around February he joined a foreign dating site and quickly became enamored with a woman in Colombia.  He went to visit her (which I was concerned about as well but made it home safe and sound.  Now, about 3 weeks later he has informed me that his latin lover is not only coming to visit, but in fact MOVING IN with us as of next week.

I am very concerned this is a green card  or immigration scam of some sort.  She does not speak English, he does not speak Spanish.

Are there any steps I can take myself / encourage him to take to protect himself financially or protect himself from possible marriage fraud?

I've lived in my new city for 10mos and have been pulled over for nothing a dozen times since my two jobs are in a redlined neighborhood and a nice suburb.

"[CA, US] Vacation benefits changed from offer acceptance to start date. I work for a Fortune 500 company in California.  I accepted an offer in the fall of 2016.  The offer did not explicitly list my PTO days, but it had a link to the current benefits site.  The current benefits site detailed that PTO days for employees in my range would be X, and a footnote that said the schedule would change on 1 Jan 2017.  My hiring was delayed by the company until 2017, and now I make X-16 hours of PTO, according to the new schedule.

"Dog Bite (CA) recurring bad owner. So my dog and I were attacked by a loose dog about a year back, I fronted all vet and hospital bills, and we're about to go into mediation with the dog's owner. Thankfully, my pup recovered very well, and the worst I've got on my end is numbness on one pinky and a bad scar on the other hand.

"Is there a way to get the legal benefits of marriage without getting married.. It seems that adult life has been set up in a way that makes things kind of complicated if you're trying to make financial decisions with someone who you are not married with. Some of the benefits of marriage include:

- Your spouse can make your medical decisions hassle free
- If you're married your spouse can get health insurance through your job and you get the family rate if it's offered
- Family leave is an option when you're married
- Making big purchases is simpler

There seems to be so many benefits but I have no interest in getting married. Are there legal ways to get some of these benefits without getting married?

I read that it carries a six point penalty on the license, which is fine, but being unfamiliar with the law in Colorado I was wondering if anyone knew what I could expect at my court date in Burlington; or if there is any way I can avoid traveling back to appear (I'm from the east coast). Are they typically lenient with out of state drivers? Is there anything specific I should say to the judge? Where I'm from the court will virtually always plea it down to something else. Is that how it works out here as well? Do I face jail time? I have some money, but not a lot, and the plane fare both ways is going to kill me this year.",0
"Breaking lease, but landlord is advertising property at 115% current rent. Is this legal? [SAN DIEGO COUNTY, CA]. Family is breaking rental agreement with landlord which dated from Oct 2016 - Oct 2017. They negotiated with landlord and agreed to part with $1000 of the original security deposit ($2400). Family rented the property for $2175/mo but the landlord is advertising property as $2500/mo, much higher than they or any neighbors pay in this area. Family is still responsible for rent until new tenant is found, but the new asking price seems unreasonable and only prolongs the time that my family is responsible for the rent. 

Is there any justification for such a drastic increase in rent, or are the landlords trying to milk my family for as much as they can?",1

"Bought a mobile home in a trailer park and having issues. So I recently purchased a mobile home. I confirmed with the owners of the park that it could stay there.

Well after paying the application fee (which is still pending) I was told I was denied and had two days to move the home or they'll tow it and charge me, unless I pay them $1500 (which so happens to be the previous owners past due amount)
 
They also went on to say I was denied due to the previous owner. I've never met the woman before buying the house.

Is this legal, what can I do? 

I have a gut feeling they're going to tow the house away regardless if I pay them. 

The lot manager even went on to say that I couldn't afford the $1500 and that even if I do pay it I'll most likely be evicted anyways",1

"Options for me when apartment won't do anything.. Not sure where exactly to post this but here goes. 

Asked manager to do something about birds nesting above living room window (2nd floor) as they are flying down and tearing apart the screen cover. Their feces also comes inside into my living room so I can't really open the window at all anymore (and it's summer). There are also what seems to be bird mites coming in as well. He won't do anything and brushes off the request form.

I believe the birds are California House Finches and I think it's legal to remove them.

Anyways he said I complain too much but I thought it was a legitimate request because I don't enjoy having bird feces indoors  combined with bird mites as I also own a dog. What are my options besides finding a new place?",1

Okay, so my friend has been renting an apartment for a couple years near the campus of the university that we attend and every semester his landlord has called him and asked if he wants to renew his contract for the next semester.

I took the advice of some in the previous post and requested the promissory note and the payment history from ACS. This ended up coming from the university itself.

Since the loan showed up in NSLDS, and I had no documentation myself proving I had paid it, I negotiated with the university to pay off just the principal (about $1600) and they forgave the interest. The loan now shows as paid in my NSLDS report and did not impact my credit, and I didn't have to pay the approximately $2000 in accumulated interest for the last 20 years.",0

"Employment unknowingly terminated. Okay so this is a UK based company. I just received a P45 letter stating that my last day of work was at the start of April. I'm on 0 hours so I usually only work the summer holidays and Christmas. I will now be free to work often but due to an abundance of staff I will remain on 0 hours. However I worked in May and received my pay fine, the letter does state my last payment which I received last month. I am covering shifts this month and I am due to work very shortly so I'm unsure how I have somehow 'left'. I'm concerned that I now won't get paid for the shifts coming up but it's odd how it states I left in April but then mentions my June pay which came from May.

"Landlord threatens eviction for nonpayment despite receiving rent for the month (TN, USA). Hey all,

I live with two roommates in a well-populated city in Tennessee, USA. We pay our rent in separate checks in the same envelope ahead of schedule every month, including this month (July). A few hours ago I received a strongly worded notice that if I did not pay my third of the rent, plus a hefty late fee, within three days, we would all be evicted. However the check has been cashed (I have an image of the check and a receipt from my bank) and the money is gone from my account. Since these three checks were submitted together in an envelope, I'm wondering what my options are. Should I involve the police if the money was stolen from my account? I would prefer not to pay a second time, of course.

Any help is appreciated.",1

"[MA] Am I allowed to take off my shoes in the Cambridge Public Library. This seems petty, but I'm actually interested in the answer.

I am sitting in the Cambridge Public Library, reading, and have kicked off my flip-flops onto the floor. A man came by and told me I had to put my shoes on because it is a public building.

Now I don't really care about having my shoes on or off, but I tend to go barefoot a lot and have never been asked that around here before. So I decided to look up the law, and at least in the [Cambridge City Ordinances](https://library.municode.com/ma/cambridge/codes/code_of_ordinances) am unable to find any mention of shoes at all.

"Lawn mower delivery = theft by taking?. On 7/4/17 my wife and I purchased a riding lawn mower in the state of Georgia. The store advised they would set up for the free local delivery, but if we were able to come back that day and get it, they would cancel the delivery. 

We came back the same day and got the mower, but the past couple days they have been making delivery confirmation calls.

"Can I legally drive a car insured only by my husband? (California). Hi,
I am not entirely sure where to post this but I have a question about insurance.

6 years ago when I was a drinking alcoholic (since in recovery, 4 years sober!) I got a DUI. My insurance rates have been high because of this. I was recently married and my mother suggested I get my car fully insured under my husbands name and the rate would go down. We called and it would, by about $2500 a year, even at completely full and comprehensive coverage.

But is this legal? Does the car technically have to be insured by the primary driver or is it different because we are married? The car is under my name, but we can always transfer it.

I was planning on this week going to go get the paperwork to begin the process over again.

My question is they can't fire him due to him being in the system so what can I do to get a rightful firing? Or more how do they see he is a danger because this will not show up on his background check until he is arrested with is based on a grand jury.

"Trying to get suspension lifted on my license [Louisiana]. I've been working to get all holds on my license taken off. I was told I owed $1,300 to a county in Louisiana (I currently reside in Arizona). I paid the money, but realized the hold never came off my license. Turns out I have a seperate ticket in the City Court that has a bench warrant attached to it. They said I owe $710, must be paid in full (No payment options) or I can get my butt to the court where I will be jailed for 45 days as retribution to the ticket. I don't have 710 bucks and honestly I would do the time if i could get to Louisiana but that's not an option, either.

"[California] Mom divorced husband and can't get spousal support because he never filed taxes. Hi everyone 

Basically my Mom finally had her mediation meeting with her ex-husband and their lawyers. They've been married for about 3 years prior. 

In a battle for spousal support, his lawyer told my Mom that since he hasn't filed taxes for 2014-2017 and owes back taxes from before that, that she's legally accountable for half of it. So instead of having the IRS come after her, they'll opt to give her 0 spousal support. 

My Mom's lawyer argued back, stating my Mom **NEEDS** some form of support, so they agreed upon $800 a month for 6 months. 

Is this all we can really pull? Is this really how the law works? My Mom marries a new man and finds out he never filed his taxes during the divorce, so therefore she'll be screwed over because of his mistakes?",0
"How Do I Get Access / Buy Rights To All My Video Footages And Have Them Destroyed?. Hi

From the time I was 13 to 18, I was part of a children's TV show which basically contained a 'News Bulletin' and programs for pre-teens and teens, dealing with various issues of the day and interviewing 'Young-Achievers', etc.

The show was never that popular and is off-the-air right now, but during my time in the show, I've done some things that would be embarrassing if someone views them now. I've gone through an extensive image makeover and want all these things associated with my past to be deleted forever.

I am willing to spend money if it's required to buy the rights of these footages and then would like to make sure they are never aired and are completely taken off the internet.

"[CO] Possession Charge. Hello,

I live in the great state of Colorado, where you can get high legally in more ways than one!

Unfortunately that was not always the case, and in 2009 I received a possession charge.  It's really messing with my job (background checks) and would like to see what options I have.

It seems expunging would only work if I was under 18 (alas I was over 18 at the time) so I think my only option is to 'seal' the record.

I tried to talk to a few lawyers about this, even paid one... the result was just more confusion.  I tried talking to the assistant DA, they were not very helpful either.

It seems I need to wait 10 years, then file a bunch of paperwork, pay some money, and then the state will tell me if the record can be sealed or not...?

Can someone please help me understand the process for getting this sealed?

"California marijuana laws: Where can I smoke it?. The law is pretty clear on where I can smoke recreational marijuana.  However, the medical use laws are a bit confusing.

Correct me if I'm wrong.  As I understand it, the Compassionate Use Act allows a patient to use wherever tobacco smoking is allowed.  Then came Prop 64, recreational use.  Health &amp; Safety code 11362.3(a), a recreational law, says basically that you cannot smoke in public.  However, 11362.3(f) says, ""Nothing in this section shall be construed or interpreted to amend, repeal, affect, restrict, or preempt laws pertaining to the Compassionate Use Act of 1996.""

"Mom has been in the hospital for months. She can't talk, hasn't walked and gets bloated. (Chicago). My mother had a heart attack in March and she's been in two different hospitals since then. The first hospital released her to the second with an idea that when she recovers there, she'll go to another rehab facility. She has not recovered and the issues are still going on. (For context, she was told she should have triple bypass surgery which I agreed to.). 

I'm not sure what to do legally or personally at all. We have a house and I own a condo. Another hospital that wants to take her for rehab wants her on Medicaid, but she can't get on it because she has assets that go beyond the requirement. I also don't have access to all the financials in any case because I can't get my mother in her current condition, to sign a power of attorney. 

Again, I'm not sure what to do.",0
[OH] Do I qualify for the Department of Education's Borrower Defense to Repayment program?. So I received [this letter](http://imgur.com/a/spDd1) in the mail today along with a settlement check in the mail today.  This is the very first I've heard of a law suit against DeVry for fraudulent advertising.  I attended DeVry from 2010-12 and incurred significant student loans but never graduated.  The loan in question is actually in default and it would be absolutely amazing for my life if I could get out of paying it back.  That probably makes me sound like a horrible human being but I'll live with it if I can get out from underneath that mountain of debt.  I went to [the mentioned website](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/borrower-defense) but I really don't understand if I qualify or not.  If anyone could advise I'd greatly appreciate it.,0
"Who has legal access to the spring water on my property?. We purchased a large farm a few months ago.  On this farm is a spring that feeds my house as well as two other homes.  The spring is fully on my property.  

I made a mistake and let the spring run dry while I let the hose run overnight watering my garden.  The undereducated neighbors were upset (I don't blame them).  I take blame for running it dry,  and the spring was full again in twelve hours.  However, they are threatening to sue (?) to make sure this doesn't happen again.

I looked up the the courthouse deeds for any easements or other agreements on all three properties, and there is nothing in place.

My question is, in Pennsylvania, what legal rights do they have to this water?  I don't intend to shut off their supplies, but want to know where I stand legally.  

Any advice would be very much appreciated!",1

"Are there any options of legal recourse in either California or Washington for an Etsy shop with misleading information about their product?. My fiancé and I live in California and after shopping around for a while, we decided on an engagement ring that was from an Etsy shop in WA.

"[ID] Ex-Landlord holding security deposit. I need advice concerning an apartment I rented with a 10-month fixed lease in Idaho.  The move-in and move-out date was clearly stated in the lease I signed.  I gave the landlord 9 days of notice prior to moving out.  Now, as I try to get my security deposit back, I am told that since I didn’t give 30 days of notice - which is not stated as a requirement in the lease - they are keeping the deposit and charging me for an additional month's rent.

"MN - Definition of ""premises"" for purposes of apartment lease?. My apartment and the rest in the building specifies that tenants may not allow smoking on premises.

Typically, how should this be interpreted? Is the premises the interior or does it include the balcony? Does it also include the common areas?

Also, what can I do as a tenant if a landlord won't enforce this? I've read that breathing problems MIGHT be considered a disability that he would have to accommodate, but is not smoking near my front door or within however many feet of my balcony even a reasonable accommodation to request? And if another tenant is already not following the rules and is smoking inside, would getting proof of a need for accommodation from my doctor even be worthwhile?

"(SC) SWIM using drugs while pregnant.. SWIM is pregnant and due in 12 weeks. During her pregnancy, she has casually and infrequently used opiates, bentos, amphetamines as recently as last week. She is not physically addicted to anything and isn't a regular user. She has agreed to stop for the remainder of the pregnancy but I have read newborn meconium tests go back 20 weeks. As far as she knows, she hasn't been drug screened at her checkups, or at least they haven't said anything.  

1) When the baby is born, will it be tested? 
2) If the results are positive, what will happen? 
3) Would it be advisable for her to confess to her doctor now rather than being ""caught""?
4) She also has a toddler. If CPS is involved, will it involve her current child too? 

I don't support her actions but unfortunately it's happening. Most curious as to the answer to #3 as I could possibly urge her to do this.",0
"Will a caution for drugs show up on a police records check for visa?. Location Vic/ Australia 
I received a caution/ drug diversion for possession/ being under the influence of LSD along with a caution for possession of a air rifle last year (I'm young and stupid, that's a cop out but that's the truth). 

I'm currently trying to apply for a working visa for Canada and for jobs. They ask about previous convictions and cautions including driving offences. I understand it's in my best interest to be truthful but I also know it could ruin my chances to mention these offences. 

What I want to know is will they show up on a background check for my visa? I was told by police they wouldn't show up on police records checks for work as they are only cautions but I don't know if the visa application is more in depth.

"[ID] Can loan payments represent interest in property?. The issue concerns a woman who owned a property and its old mobile home, and was paying off a loan on the property in 2002. She wanted another loan (so she could buy a new mobile home) but had bad credit. The USDA would not refinance the property and advised her to sign over the property to her (now ex) boyfriend and she did, 15 years ago. She has continued to live on the property, while the former boyfriend made the home loan payments ($624/month). The ex-boyfriend received a second loan in 2006 to build the new mobile home, for which she has been making the payments ($50/month).

I opted to pay the fine in monthly installments since at the time I was preparing for a newborn and didn't account for the extra expense of the ticket. So a few months go by and I thought everything has been settled and having completed traffic school but I get a letter in the mail saying I only made one monthly payment. It turns out I had to manually make the monthly payments and they weren't recurring. I called the courts offices and they said I can't do anything, I need to pay it through a collection agency now which almost tripled the ticket and if I write a letter to the courts they might allow me to retake traffic school since they couldn't accept it the first time due to not having completed payments.

So we smoke across the street and up a couple of houses.

"[KS maybe MD] Engine blew under warranty, are they liable for additional damages caused by the blow out?. Original engine in my car died. I decided to replace the engine with a rebuild engine from a reputable company out of MD (I'm in KS) with great ratings. I also picked up their additional ""No Fault"" warranty because this engine is prone to troubles. Replacement went fine, but 2k miles into the rebuilt engine blows a rod out the bottom of the engine.  This time the rod does an additional ~6,000 worth of damage to other components. Company is willing to replace engine but says the rest of the damage is not on them. New engine is useless without the additional repairs.

On the citation it says ""Yellow Time: 4.2 sec, Red Time: 0.2 sec"" which from what I can gather means the light had been red .2 seconds at that point when I crossed the line. I am really surprised that they are mailing me about a ticket for .2 seconds and it honestly sounds ridiculous. It's literally fractions of a second. I googled around a bit and found some other state had their law written that nothing less than .3 seconds was ticket-able which I guess is slightly more reasonable.

"[NY] Taking lifeguard course for personal/family benefit, any increase in liability?. Hey all,

Apologies if the answer is clear, I've done a bunch of research and couldn't find the answer from a definitively reputable source. 

My question is: If I take a lifeguard course/certification just so i'm more prepared if the need arose for my family/friends, is there any increased liability if there was an issue while attempting to save family/friends/strangers since there is a certification attached?

While one might quickly say no, a similar situation to consider would be getting one's boat captain license. Even if you're piloting a boat for friends for fun, you become legally liable for their safety as a _professional captain_ since you're licensed whether or not you're on-duty/getting paid. 

Maybe the safest thing liability-wise to do would be to take the course without attempting certification?

I was told that they knew and that my mother had accidentally seen the video when she went to turn off his computer. 

Both him and his girlfriend are under 16 and my parents have confronted him telling him how illegal this is and stuff but he is just not listening and denying everything. There was no like actual sex but just other stuff in the video apparently.

"Golf course fishing/assault?. Hey everybody,

my friend and I are both minors who recently went fishing on a golf corse with no ""no fishing"" or ""private property"" signs. It was pretty late and there only about 5 golfers out.

We were minding our own business, walking through the rough area surrounded by trees and carrying our fishing poles when we were approached by 3 golfers. One brought a golf club with him and told us it was private property and fishing was illegal. The other guy was a little more intense and calling us names. 

We said there were was no sign and we've been up here several times. We also asked if they worked there, to which they denied. We wouldn't budge and tried to walk away when Golfer 2 grabbed my friend by the back of his shirt and threatened him to leave. Before things got ugly, we dipped out.

What can we do about this? I managed to get a decent picture of the guy as I was walking away.",0
"Is tying up a girl in a bikini and tickling her considered child porn?. My daughter, who is 16, rather foolishly allowed a guy to tie her up, tickle her, and videotape the whole thing, in return for $100. This guy has a business of some sort, but I can't tell if it's legitimate.  He has a business card but no website or anything, and this videotaping took place at his apartment.  

I found out about this and called the number on the business card and spoke to someone.  At first the guy who answered was polite, and said that our permission was not needed because the video is not for public release.  But when I asked him to delete the video, he refused, and then hung up on me.  

Is this considered producing child porn?  She was clothed (barely) but this was obviously sexual in nature.  Can I get him in trouble somehow?  I don't want other young girls to be victimized by this kind of abuse.

As the title says, mom is in jail after driving drunk in a car that was put in my name. I am currently living about 2.5 hours away from what has happened and was only told because her roommate gave me a call saying we need somebody to co-sign, like my grandparents, a document confirming she'll go to the court dates so that she can be released. They didn't ask for money for the bail because they got it from her paychecks.

So my real question is could I have any legal repercussions for her driving in what is technically ""my car""?

"Is it legal to trace images from a video game and use them in a YouTube video? [US]. I've been writing some episodes of an animated series I plan to post on YouTube in the future, after my animation skills improve. A few of the episodes, however, have scenes that take place in an amusement park. My animations are hand-drawn (I never could figure out computer animation, and I think traditional/2D looks better anyway).

To hopefully avoid the tremendous work that would be animating these rides from scratch, I briefly considered building a replica of the amusement park in Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, taking some videos, and tracing the images to use in my animated series. But before I decide to do this, would it get me in any legal trouble?

2. I would only be tracing the rides themselves (and possibly some scenery)

I wasn't sure where to ask this, but my apartment complex recently installed a gate that was not present when I began my lease. 

The apartment management has made a rule where they were only give one gate key card per apartment unit. This means that either me or my wife can have a key but not both. This leaves one of us trapped at home  or having to wait for someone to come open the gate and risk driving through directly behind them.

It had been suspended for quite a while, over a year. I've paid my fines and gotten my license reinstate. Colorado laws says I have to have knowledge of the suspension but I'm not sure how I can prove I was unaware. I can't afford an attorney. I can bring bank records to show I used Uber to get to work from the time I was suspended until it was reinstated. I remember receiving notices in the mail about the ticket but got nothing saying I was suspended, when spoke with the credit agency holding the account for my unpaid ticket they had an incorrect address for me, should I mention this? Any advice would be appreciated, I don't know what to do or what to expect. My court date is Thursday. Thank you ahead of time for any advice or encouragement.",0
"School Debt. So... When I was 17 I decided it was a good idea to begin taking out school loans (10,000-12,000 per year for 5 years) to go to a private Christian college. Dumbest decision of my life. This is my ONLY regret in life so far. I can't believe NO ONE told me it WASN'T a good idea to be taking out this much money in loans. I didn't even enjoy my time in college. It was terrible and the school was going through financial difficulties and it impacted the students negatively (so I feel that I didn't even get a quality education). Now it's been 3 years since graduation and I'm still regretting all of this. Almost every day I wish there was a way to retract my debt (even if it means retracting my BA). I'm sure I'm just screwed, but legally is there anything I could do to get out of this debt? Like suing the school or something? I'm sure there's not but it's on my mind pretty much all day everyday so I figured I'd at least ask. Thanks in advance!",0
"[California] 15 years ago I plead guilty to a felony I did not commit and received a 'strike'. What are my options for getting that strike off of my record?. The police officer blatantly lied in the police report and if I can locate the victim, I can prove it. The victim (a store clerk) didn't even speak English but the police report has sentences of things I supposedly said to him, including a death threat which I never made. If I can locate that store clerk and have him verify

1. he didn't understand what I was saying
2. as such, he didn't understand a death threat I never made
3. he was not scared for his life based on that death threat 

then: 4. i'm not guilty of criminal threats, which is what i plead guilty to.

How to do that I don't know. I've emailed several lawyers and none respond. I imagine this doesn't fit within the confines of their usual churning out plea bargain framework so they don't want to bother with it.

"(PH) My boyfriend sent my nudes to my friends. He is in Michigan, USA and I'm here in the Philippines. What to do?. Yes, you read that right. Even he did that he's still my boyfriend until now but that's because I'm afraid that if I don't agree to get back with him and ""forgive"" him, he'd spread more nudes because according to him he has more photos. 

He sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. ALL ARE MY STUDENTS. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.

"Assault Charge with settlement of 30k. I was recently involved in an altercation in Seoul, South Korea including 2 of my other friends. We were semi-sober and we were walking home. We accidentally bump into a Korean National and he decides to grab and hold on to one of my friends. I in my right mind was trying to break up the fight by pulling the Korean guy away from my OTHER friend that was punching the guy to let go of the one he has a grasp on. In the video and from what I remember I was just standing around at one point and yelling at the both of the because they were going at it. I ended up being allegedly accused of an assault charge and so did my both of my friends. When in reality only one of us got into an actual fist fight with the guy. He was 30,000,000 Korean Won (which is about 30k roughly) from all 3 of us and all of us being a minor we have no way to compensate.

"Unleashed cat killed by leashed dog on my property. Texas.. I'm traveling and recently got a hysteric call from my wife. Our cat was chilling under a car in our driveway when a neighbor walking a dog walked by. The dog got excited, pulled away from the owner, and managed to scare the cat enough to leave the relative safety of the car. The dog caught the cat and killed it.

Neighbors have video of parts of the incident I've been told.

I'm not interested compensation, as it's be meaningless. but we and neighbors have small children and this concerns me, as the owner was wholly incapable of stopping or controlling the dog. She told my wife that the cat instigated the encounter, which I'm told by a neighbor is not the case.

My wife described it as a bulldog, but I suspect she means pitbull. I'm not sure til I see video.

What action should I take to ensure a safe neighborhood... does this need to be reported to police, animal control, or some other body?",0
"overseas lawsuit over privacy issues - realistic or not ?. Hello,

The company I am having issues with are holding my account that I have them under certain restrictions (one of which is quite serious, money related) due to a claim of theirs to which I do not agree. They want to video interview me over the internet. Not sure why they wanted to do that but there is no such thing explicitly written in their ToS. I find this rather intrusive regarding my privacy, not to mention unprofessional and quite barbaric.
And no, there have been no reports of any sort of fraudulent activity on my account that I know of, my track of record is excellent there, and they have already verified my account about 8 years ago.
The company is based in California, USA, I am based in the EU, Romania.

Are there any USA / EU / international laws protecting my privacy over the internet that I could enforce upon them ? Do I stand a fair chance of winning such a lawsuit ?

Thank you",0

I waited for the walk sign to turn on and went when it said to.  This girl was taking a left turn and ran right into me.  She stopped and asked if I was okay which I replied, ""I think so."" Because I was in shock, I probably didn't do everything right.  She gave me her business card and left.  A couple of witnesses called 911 and stayed with me.  The cop said she did everything right and that it was an accident, although she was at fault.  She said the sun was in her eyes.  My question is, do I have any grounds to get compensation for the anxiety this accident has caused me?  I already have bad anxiety issues and this has exacerbated it.  Also, I had to spend 6 hours in the ER, I am assuming her car insurance is going to foot the bill?  Any suggestions for next steps are greatly appreciated.",0

My parents are currently having a problem, and I was wondering if there is any legal recourse.

There are several trees that are on my neighbors property.

"Not Paying a Parking Ticket in Canda, on a US Rental Car?. Hello, so like the title suggests, i've received a parking ticket in the city of Ottawa while visiting from the United States (New Hampshire) My Hertz rental car (Florida plates) was correctly ticketed when i forgot to move my car. 

Now, the ticket correctly identifies my car via the plate number, but in the Province section it says  ""FL"" for florida.  Not sure if that matters.

I've heard that out of province people don't have to pay the ticket because it's not legally enforceable. I understand that New York has an agreement with Quebec if this happens that it is enforceable. 


So here's my question. Is this something I should pay? Will I have any issues entering the country in the future if i don't? And will they notify Hertz? (Hertz is available in Canada) because the car belongs to them (Hertz USA) 

It's a $120 fine, or $100 if paid before ""01/08/2017"" which i'm guessing is  DD/MM/YYYY, so August 1st.",0
"Taking an unpaid ""working lunch"" [NE]. I work at a state park in Nebraska. I am currently the only one working in a small store. On my off days someone else works so I have 2 days off. My hours have recently been changed to factor in a half hour lunch, and I am currently at a point where I work exactly 40 hours a week. However, my boss told me that I will have to take a ""working lunch."" That essentially means I remain in the building and continue to work through my lunch, but I am not paid for it. My math shows that I am missing out on 2.5 overtime hours every week.

I am currently a part time employee, so they do not want me working over 40 or else the state gets upset. I told a colleague about my situation and he suggested I keep working until I am done for the season, then pursuit legal action. Tonight at the end of my shift I'm going to collect all past pay stubs and keep them organized.

"""Girls only"" house. (SC). I have a male friend who was scheduled to move into a room at a single family home where all of the rooms are rented individually. The landlords do not live in the home and they aren't using a company to manage tenants. 

His friend is the current tenant and she gave him the heads up that she was moving out so he could talk with the landlords about moving in. My friend went through the guy landlord and confirmed that the room was available and verbally confirmed that he wanted the room and the guy landlord agreed. 

Today my friend gets a text from his friend (the current tenant) with an attached email stating that the girl landlord decided she wanted to make the property an ""All girls property"" and they would let my friend know. My friend later received an email from the landlord simply stating the room is no longer available for rent.

"I have money tied up in a fund in Taiwan. Hi all,

Hoping someone with knowledge of Taiwanese finance can chime in.

I was born in Taiwan and when I was young my mother bought me some sort of fund - she told me recently that it has grown massively.

However, I moved here when I was very young and have since become a US citizen. I'll be returning to Taiwan next year for an internship and while I was there I wanted to move the money to the US so I could more easily access the funds. 

The thing is, since I've turned 18, the my mother could no longer access the money, only I can. Since I've moved, I've changed my last name (technical adoption) and am not sure how to prove to them that I am in fact me.

How do I go about doing that? Will there be any taxes involved in liquidating about 200 K in assets? How do I transfer that money to the US? Should I have a lawyer assist me while I am there? I don't speak mandarin very well and cannot write even my name.

I fell behind on payments to a student loan to Navient. Navient is now contacting a co-signer to another loan and demanding he make the payments. Can they do this?. Due to an unexpected medical expense I have missed 2 payments on a student loan. This loan is in my name only and does not have a cosigner. I have a cosigner for another loan that is almost paid off and has never missed a payment. These are both private loans and are both serviced by Navient. My cosigner for the loan that has no missed payments called me yesterday to tell me that Navient has contacted him and told him that my loan has missed payments and is demanding that he make the payments that were missed. They made it seem like the loan he co-signed on is the one that is behind. This is not the case at all and i double checked to confirm. Are they allowed to do this?

"Failing concrete wall my neighbors problem or mine? (MN). The brick wall that separates my back yard from my neighbors is failing and crumbling.

Upon the expiration of the term of each of such trustees, the appointing authority shall, unless the water authority has determined to elect trustees as provided in Section 5.1, appoint his successor, who shall serve for a term of 3 years.”

"""Working Condition"" of A/C. A family I know just sold a house. They had been renting the house out for 2-3 years prior to selling.

The seller does not believe that the buyers have an argument as the air conditioning ""works"". The tenants who reported the problem had the refrigerant refilled and had no complaints after that.

The buyer threatened some sort of legal action (but I personally believe that to be a bluff). 

I guess the questions that I would like answered are:

1) what constitutes as ""working condition"", it's clear that the a/c still works if you just refill the refrigerant

2) are the sellers liable for the full repair costs/were they obligated to list the leak in the disclosure if the a/c was still working to their knowledge (I do not know if they knew about the leak or not)",1
"Hospital billed insurance too late, now billing me the full cost. I live in Washington state.

We gave the hospital our insurance information, were discharged and didn't hear from them again.  In April 2017, we got an EOB in the mail from the insurance company saying that our responsibility is the full amount because the hospital didn't bill within our plan's ""timely filing limit"".  A few months later, in June 2017, we got the bill for the full amount from the hospital.

I'm not sure what our next action should be, my thought is that we write a letter to the hospital informing them that we will not be responsible for paying the full bill as it was their neglecting to bill the insurance that caused the problem.

"[Texas] moving out of apartment issue. Hello Reddit,
First off all, sorry for the grammar, I'm posting this on my phone.
So I'm living in an apartment complex close to campus, and my lease expired Aug 8th. Originally we planned on renew our lease for another year, but since the rent for next year increased a bit too much over the budget, we looked and found another place that we can moved in July 24th. Now we just received our offer for renewing the lease at the beginning of this month (with the new rent rate). However, our current landlord required us to give 60 days notice before moving out. Our landlord put us under month to month payment instead of a renewal. That would put our move out date to Sept 12 (we put in our written notice July 12). 
My question is, are there anyway we can avoid or minimal the rent for an empty apartment for a whole month of August and a part of Sept? We are college student and we can't afford paying rent for 2 places with 1 place being empty.

My question has to deal with being unpaid during a medical accommodation request.

"Question regarding ""intimidation"" as a crime.. I'm in Ireland so this doesn't really regard me, but I saw that in Montana, intimidation is defined as follows:

    (a) inflict physical harm on the person threatened or any other person;
    (b) subject any person to physical confinement or restraint; or

At the time he was sore but no severe or lasting pain. Two weeks later, he was laid off for the winter season, starting back to work in April. In early December he was casting a fishing rod and his shoulder dislocated. He was able to pop it back in and has been fine until the last few months. He has had his shoulder dislocate a number of times since April and more recently 3 times over the last week. These dislocations are severely painful for him, to the point that the pain is unbearable for him. A doctor's appointment with xray results showed that there was an past (healed) fracture and new liesions, most likely as a result of repeated dislocations. I am wondering if this is a workmans comp issue since the only fall that could have caused a fracture was at work last November, or if this would not qualify for workman's comp.",0
"California, Covina. My grandmother is getting abused and clearly cant take care of herself, but her daughter is abusing her and draining her and wont let her go. What can I do?. My 92 year old grandmother is currently decaying away in her home losing her mind. She has been injured various times but plays it off with insane excuses. She is clearly not mentally fit to be all on her own.

Currently she is in the ""care"" of my aunt, in which her daughter forced her so that she controls all my grandmother's finances. Right now the aunt does nothing at all, and worsens my grandmother's physical state.

In general the aunt is a big obstacle.

What can I do to help this situation? Ideally I'd want my grandmother to move in with me so I can actually take care of her but im unsure if my aunt would let that happen. It's come to the point where the aunt drains her pension each month not even leaving her enough for groceries.

Legally what are my options, alternatively i'd want her in an old folks home.",0
"Old college landlord trying to stick me with over priced damage charges. $1300. Just received a letter from my old college landlord asking for $1k on top of my $300 security deposit for damages at my last apartment.  I only stayed there for the fall semester and subleased the spring semester out.  These damages are ridiculously overprice.  $180/person for carpet cleaning (there was 4 of us), $200/person for general house cleaning.

We did do some damage but this is insane.. I didnt take any photos when we moved in but a lot of these damages were there before.  I need to get out of paying the majority of this.

I was thinking asking for proof of all damages and receipts of all cleanings/repairs, and then threatening a lawyer if I was forced to pay for pre-existing damages.  What should I do? This is a sleezebag college landlord that is very sketchy.  The letter I received threatens the bill will be sent to collections if payment is not received in 10 days but I'm not sure he'd even do that.",1
"[WA] HIPAA Violation report.... Briefly...

I make a HIPAA Violation report about my employer.

When you do this, there is a box that you can check that says that you do not want your information revealed to the company you are reporting.

Today I get a call from my employer... basically saying... about that HIPAA report you made about us...

Awkward.

I contact HHS.gov.  They confirmed that they erroneously revealed my information to my employer.

I do understand that my employer cannot legally retaliate against me.  (At least not overtly.  But who knows what my performance reviews are going to look like over the years).

I also understand that at least as of right now... I have no damages.

So I suspect that I answered my own question...

Except that it seems like a pretty big deal that the agency that you are reporting privacy violations to are violating your privacy.

Do you think this is something I should consider pursuing?  Or do I need to just sit back and wait for enumerable damages?",0
"I went through an apartment locator - Apartment changed the price after I applied and was charged an app fee. I'm moving to Atlanta, GA with my wife. We used an apartment locator service where they look for apartments within your budget and with your preferred specifics (floors, size, location, etc.)

I was given a quote for an apartment for $1150 per month. I applied, was charged the $300 application fee, and now the apartment is saying the apartment is actually $1250 per month instead.

I have saved documentation from the apartment locator service, my application states the correct apartment and price, and I had phone conversation with the lady at the front desk about the apartment and the correct price.

Essentially, if I stay, I have to get a different apartment that doesn't fit our needs, I have to pay an extra $100 per month for the one I actually want, or I'll end up forfeiting the application fee for nothing.

I've been in touch with the apartment staff. They won't budge.

The violation concerns another forgery case from a different state in which the defendant took a plea deal and got 3 years probation and was then extradited to face a probation violation for the above cases.

From what I can tell there was a 60 month sentence and a 60 day sentence laid down to be served concurrently on 6/12. However the defendant was released from custody on the 14th and remains out. Then it seems on the 21st the case continues in some way. The probation seems to have been terminated unsuccessfully instead of revoked which I understand to be two different things, correct? Then where does the 60 months come from? Also what is ""pay or appear"" exactly?

"New Jersey - Trying to take down a Police Department Created FaceBook post about an arrest 4 years ago. Hello! In 2013, a friend was arrested for marijuana possession in New Jersey. This particular Police Department likes to post all drug related arrests on their FaceBook page. Well, here we are 4 years later, the charges were “Conditionally Discharged”, and this post is still up, and out there trackable with a quick Google search.
My question, is there any way to have them remove this post? My friend is trying to get out of retail, and apply for a desk job, where they will likely Google their name. We have not yet contacted the department to have it down; I wanted to check here for the best ‘strategy’. Isn’t it time to move on from the past? Do the crime, pay the time, and move on. This one post may prevent someone from moving on with their life, and I don’t like the thought of that. Any chance they will be sympathetic without involving a lawyer?

"Landlord Hasn't Returned Security Deposit (Maryland). Thanks in advance for any help.

Today is the 45th day and I still have not heard from my landlord. How exactly should I proceed?

All rent increases above 5% had to go through a certain procedure, and because I was not aware of it, failed to comply with it then. However, I recently found out about it and was planning to follow the proper procedures for this year's rent increase. I wanted to increase the rent to $2000, taking into note that the apartment was not refurnished, as most 2 bedrooms in Alameda are at least $2200. However, because I did not comply with the procedures the first time, I have to refund back the difference in rent to the tenant as the rent increase was invalid. Therefore, I would have to pay the tenant $4200. And they have determined that the rent increase should be from $1350 to $1500 for this year. What can/should I do now to ensure the least losses?",1
"(VA) Guy emailed me based on a Craigslist post I made. In the email he admitted to some illegal things. Is there a way to anonymously report him?. So I posted on Craigslist looking for women or couples who will let me jerk off in their panties/thongs (yes, I'm weird).  A guy emailed me about it, but when I asked if he would ask for or if he had his girl's permission this is what he said:

She wouldn't be into it. But she won't find out either. I've cum in her panties many times and put them back in her drawer. She's never known. 
I've even used her when she's passed out drunk and cum on her face. She never knew. 

Is there a way to report this? If so, how do I do it and is there a way to do it anonymously?  Will I have to talk to the police myself, or can I just submit the emails?

I'm kind of freaked out right now, and would like to avoid doing this publicly because I'm kind of embarrassed about my craigslist post/fetish...

All I have is his email address and the messages.  I have not yet responded to that last email",0
"illegal to say I'd like to see other people kill dirty cops??. So I saw something on Facebook about a cop that died. 

I stupidly posted that I hope more cops die and that they deserve it because of the way they treat other people/ inmates ect 

In my closing line I wrote 

A bullet for a cop is a bullet for freedom 

I was referring to dirty cops or the ones who abuse there power. 

After that I posted 

For clarity  I do not wish to kill any cops myself and I'm personally against killing cops. 

But I wouldn't be sad if other people did kill cops. 

Some butt hurt idiot said they screen capped the post and sent it to my local police department Facebook messages. 

Honestly  I'm not going to or have I ever disrespected or killed a cop. 


But I honestly thought I had the right to say how I feel about a situation. 

I know it was a stupid post.

But I clearly stated I didn't want to kill anybody myself. 

So at worst it could be a hate crime??? 

Honestly don't feel like going to jail over some stupid post on Facebook ",0
"My apartment caught on fire and my landlord is trying to claim negligence to get me to cover the damages. I came back to my apartment yesterday after studying at the library to see it on fire.  The cause of the fire was determined that the back left stove was on which heated a pan which then then heated a toaster which consequently caused the outlet it was plugged into to catch on fire.  My landlord is expecting me to pay, due to negligence, for the damages to the unit, i understand im liable for my personal property damaged.  However, in the pictures i took while the fire department was there none of the knobs on my stove where on.  In addition, the outlet which was the actual cause of the fire did not have Arc Fault Circuit interrupters which would have prevented the fire in the first place.  Also my stove had broke the in early June and had maintenance done on it by that apartment complex.  I am therefore asking where do i go from here?

"Hotel fee paid twice over. I paid my roommate, let's call them Blake, the $173.96 owed for my share of our hotel room for a convention through Venmo.  I was told that they did not receive this payment and asked to pay them in cash.  I (accidentally mixing up the amount slightly) paid them $176.93 in cash in front of three of our four other roommates.  I ended up leaving the room after one out of four nights, due to another roommate's hygiene issues; this is unrelated.  After the night I left, I asked for part of the hotel fee I paid back, as I had not stayed the full duration; I received a long, angry text not only denying my request for a partial refund, but also claiming that I should be paying a cancellation fee to Blake and their partner because I had left without consulting them.  After the convention, I contacted Venmo trying to get my initial payment back; they responded telling me that Blake themselves would have to email Venmo, as the payment had gone through.  How do I go about getting back my initial $173.96?",0
"Michigan - Landlord's right to enter. My girlfriend's landlord walked right into her apartment without knocking or without any notice whatsoever. He was there to drop off keys. She was asleep in bed and half naked at the time. She lives there with a roommate, but the landlord does not live in the apartment. He told her it's his apartment and he can come and go as he pleases. She is super creeped out now. 

I've looked at her lease (which is starting to look pretty shady to me now) and under **Inspection of Premises** it says he has the right at all reasonable to times to enter the premises for the purpose of inspection, building, and improvements. 

The lease gives no mention of him having to give notice before entry.

I've been looking into Michigan rental laws, but it seems like this particular area is tricky. Apparently, landlords don't *have* to give notice to enter at **reasonable times**, but what is considered a reasonable time? Do they get to just walk into the house unannounced without even knocking on the door?",1
"[NC] Title IX question regarding University Recreation Center. I thought i'd come get a more informed opinion before I go forward with this.  

I'm a student at a public university in the NC state system. Our recreation center provides a specific kind of barbell in the weight room for student usage, it is a 20kg weightlifting bar meant for males.  

This type of barbell is also made for women with different specifications; shorter length and thinner diameter, as these characteristics are better suited for female athletes/exercisers. Our recreation center does not provide an equal amount, or even one, women's weightlifting bar. We have plenty of female students that would benefit from having them.  

Based on a cursory overlook of the Title IX provisions am I on solid ground bringing this to the attention of the recreation center management? I feel as though they'd be forced to act on it immediately to provide more equipment and thus equal access/opportunity for both sexes.  

Any input or corrections would be appreciated.",0
"Paternity establishment. Georgia. Hi I'm really sorry if this is a stupid question, I have just never had to deal with court or legal things and I figured I would give this a shot. I am trying to find out exactly what sort of paperwork may be needed or what can be done.

A little background, I have a 17 month old child with a man. He is not in the picture. My son is on Medicaid so now the state has said they want to go after him for money. When I was filling out the paperwork, there was an option for medical assistance only so I checked that. I don't want or need child support from this man but I understand the state wanting to go after him for the medicaid.

I have court later this week but I believe it is just a paternity establishment case since paternity has not been established and the father is not on the birth certificate. I am just wondering what to expect so any advice would be appreciated. Again, sorry if this is a stupid post. I am just stressing out over this whole situation even though I probably shouldn't be.",0
"Friend's employer engages in shady business practices. But is what they're doing illegal?. My friend works for a small moving and storage company. The owner regularly overcharges customers and charges them for things they didn't agree to. Recently he charged a customer several thousands of dollars in multiple unauthorized transactions. When she filed a charge back the owner forged several documents and successfully won the dispute even though the bank told her that the signatures didn't match what was on file. She is currently filing another charge back. From what my friend tells me this is very common, and there are several complaints lodged with the BBB that back this up.

I feel like the victims could easily sue, especially since he has threatened them before, but it seems like most of his clientele are low income and probably don't have the money to do so.

My question is does this constitute fraud? Is there an agency that deals with these matters that my friend could contact to report this behavior?

"Did something really illegal happen to me? Help. [NY]. So I was working part time at this Bikini place for like 3 years, in Feb of this year they said they laid everyone off because of lack of work. Literally no one came in anymore and they were turning the place into a warehouse office, some of the windows were already being replaced, and there was saws and stuff. So the last week of Feb my manager Shana called me saying EVERYONE is getting laid off except for the HR/ceo people on the 3rd floor. The retail store will be closed. So that very day I went into the work and asked them is this true, and they said they are closing the retail store and only the private owners will continue running it via online.

 

Flash forward to today, I see they made a post on Facebook saying 4th of July week sale, Come on in! The store was open. 
Now is it only open for the 4th of july week?  Or did something shady happen in Feb? Because they typed a letter for me to give to unemployment saying the store was closed and everyone got layed off.",0
"Can a merchant use my credit card to charge for a prior disputed purchase?. So I had a long time business relationship with a supplier. A couple years ago we had a dispute on a payment, long story short I refused to pay them for the particular purchase and its somewhat a complex situation involving multiple parties. I have since continued to do business with them. 

For a recent purchase I provided them with my credit card information. I then learned several days later that they charged my card for the prior disputed balance despite having received clearly written messages we are disputing the amount, and certainly we did not authorize them to use this particular card for it.

I know the basic way to solve this is with simple court over the original value, but I want to know if they committed a crime by using my credit card for a purchase I did not authorize, and if so if I can use this as a way to convince them to return the funds?

"Rental Construction. I was informed by my landlord that they will be starting a construction project to replace all the windows and outside of the building. This will involve scaffolding and potentially plastic covering the whole side of the building. Their projected time line is six months, but every construction project they have had done has taken significantly longer then planned. I struggle with anxiety (see a doctor, take medication) and the thought of having construction right outside my window for six months (potentially longer) straight is exhausting. My home is the place I go to escape all the noise of the world and relax and they are taking that away. They are going to reduce rent by 25% for all days our windows are covered. We just signed a new year long lease a month ago and were told nothing about this project, if we had know, we absolutely would not have stayed another year.

"need to incorporate?. We are in Pennsylvania. 

We are starting up an e-commerce store that will also sell on Amazon. We are committed to this long term but need to limit costs up front. 

I have an accounting background so am somewhat familiar with incorporating, sales tax, IRS requirements etc., and possibility to incorporate in other states that are not our home state. 

What we're stuck on is wondering whether we actually should incorporate or just file for a fictitious name in PA. Filing for a fictitious name in PA requires posting a legal notice of such, which alone is a $90 cost in our county. As such I'm thinking that money would be better spent towards incorporation fees and that way we also get legal protection from personal assets in case someone misuses a product we will sell. 

Our question is which state would be best to incorporate in and should we incorporate as an LLC or regular corp or what. We're highly focused on minimizing costs up front and the ease of required filings etc. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",0

Anyone who Google searches may find old data, which is why some are telling me I should ""own up"" and be truthful if confronted about these in an interview.

"Client is trying not to pay me for website creation and maintenance. Can I hold domain ownership against them?. Short story: I was hired to fix several issues with a small company website. This included copywriting, minor code fixes via  Wix and fixing a major fubar with their domain. A predecessor had registered the domain in their personal name. Not the company. After lots of conversations with GoDaddy support, I was finally able to access the account, pay for the registration for the next two years and transfer the account to my name. I did it this way because the company would literally not give me any info on whom I should set it up under and I was under a deadline to get the domain transfered. 

Question: Can I hold on to the domain as registered owner until if and when they pay me the low four figures they owe me? It's mostly to prove a point to them, not really profit.

"GF allegedly got a ticket last year, but never received the ticket or was aware of it. Now it is in claims court. What are her options?. So today my gf got a call from a claims agency saying she owes ~$200 for a ticket she received last fall. She never received a ticket and if this is the case, it was when her brother used her car to drive into Queens, NY for work as he was borrowing her car at this time.

So, the crux of the issue is since it is in claims court, she cannot see any of the detail regarding the violation and needs to drive into Jamaica, Queens to pay. We don't know what her other options are. If you never received a ticket or summons and was never able to give any kind of plea because of this, is there any way to fight the ticket?

It seems kind of shady to me that a collection agency is the first to contact her about a ticket from last fall. She hasn't heard anything at all from any law enforcement about this ticket. She can't even see a record of it on her DMV driving record.

I am currently a student working at a camp, and am in Canada.
So we had a training week, in which we worked 35 hours total. 

Under the contract, we are to be paid ""A weekly amount $480 will be paid for employment-- not to exceed 40 hours per week.""
They said that because we worked 35 hours during training, they can deduct 5 hours of pay. But I interperted that as no matter how much we work, 1hr,10 hr, we get paid 480 a week.


They replied stating another line in the contract: ""Pay will be deducted for days of work missed, for whatever reason, and calculation of said pay will be on a pro rata basis.""


If that was their argument, I was calling bullshit (figuratively) because no day of work was missed, and that line states that you can deduct 96 for every day of work missed (Pro rata).

We've contacted new manager twice regarding our deposit and gotten no where so I looked up the owner using public records and mailed him [this letter via certified mail] (http://i.imgur.com/LgT1Mz7.png) basically asking for 1000 dollars citing **MN statute 504B.178.** It's been over twice the 21 days MN allows, I want to make sure my demands are reasonable.

"Landlord misrepresented parking situation [OH]. So, this past week I checked out an apartment that I like a lot. Their website listed their apartment complex as having off-street parking. With both myself and girlfriend having a job, this was very important to me. So I toured the place and asked the worker giving the tour about the parking situation, who told me that it costs $50/ a month per car for renting out a carport spot. This answer seemed good enough for me, and so I put in a $50 application fee and a $950 deposit. However, when meeting to sign the lease, the landlord told me that the complex has limited space and their policy was to only allow one spot per unit. This was news to me, and seemed very slimy to hold back on this detail until this point. It wouldn't be that huge of a deal normally, but there is no street parking in the general vicinity of the complex. I would love to pull out of this, but the landlord claims that this $950 deposit is non-refundable with no exceptions. Is it legal for my landlord to do this? I feel cheated.",1
"Landlord refusing written consent for pet adoption. Hello all,

I recently moved into an apartment and really wish I would have gotten to know the management company first; it has been quite a headache getting moved in and all of the appliances in working order to this point. Now that we are settled, however, we are looking to adopt a dog. The agent who found us this apartment told us it was cat/dog friendly, the apartment complex itself it very dog heavy, and while the lease we signed stated that we weren't allowed dogs without written permission from our landlord/property manager, he assured us it would be ok. 

Now, after having picked a dog from our local shelter, he has given his verbal agreement to the shelter saying that we are allowed, but refuses to give written consent to either myself or the shelter stating that, his ""word is gold"". I am afraid we might leave ourselves open to action later without this written consent. Is he allowed to say yes on the phone but not give it to us in writing???

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!",1

They used all the cards, and due to them making online purchases (with shipping to their home), and video surveillance at the restaurants they went (license plate number and faces) and I have a ton of proof that I am going to be handing over to the police. I suppose my question is, I want to recover this money, but the police straight up said ""it is US Government property and might as well be gone"". I want to recover, obviously.

"[VA - US] How to remove legal judgements from credit report? Should I get a lawyer?. Hey /r/LA!

About 7 years ago I was the victim of severe identity theft by my mother. The damages included deposits on apartments/houses, various utilities, cell phones, and forged checkbooks. Over the past few years, I have managed to get everything removed except for two instances of legal judgements in which I was named. 

One of because my checkbook was used to pay for a rental deposit, and the other was for an electric bill opened in my name. 

Everywhere I look, I'm told to get a lawyer. My fiance and I are looking into buying a home and I want to go in with clean credit instead of waiting for this to get removed. 

So, my question is this: how can I get this removed myself? If it will be much easier with a lawyer, what kind of lawyer should I be looking for? I have tried searching for ""identity theft"" specialized lawyers, but it takes me no where. I know it sounds dumb, but I don't know what area of law this falls under.

"Some questions on using images in a blog (NY). Hey all! I've recently started an NBA blog.

My parents have mentioned that this might get me into some legal trouble, but I wouldn't think so as I don't profit off the blog.

A lot of NBA YouTubers use images such as the ones I use on my website. As well, many use real footage of the NBA. These are monetized videos with hundreds of thousands of views. If they never get into trouble for using the material, is there any reason I would?

I'm planning on getting this site to be fairly big (I have the ability to promote the site pretty well, so there's a decent chance it can get pretty popular -- that sounds kinda braggy, I don't mean it in that way though haha).
I figured I should mention that because I'm guessing it's a bigger issue legality wise if the website is popular.

"LL wants a month of rent to live in apartment for a week at start of lease term.. Hello everyone,

I am moving into my first apartment this fall near my University.  I signed a lease for a two bedroom apartment with my boyfriend last November.  On the lease it says that we can move in on August 19th.  Every other apartment complex we've heard of in this town, including his current apartment, ends their lease on July 31st and begins the following year's lease on August 1st.  This lease has us move in on August 19th and move out on July 31st.  While this is frustrating because he is without an apartment for the first part of August, we understand that we screwed up and signed for a later date.  The landlord wants the cost of an entire month, $569, due on August 1st even though we are only allowed to begin moving in on the 19th.  We have asked them to move in earlier since we are already paying the cost of a month and nobody will be in the apartment, but they have said no.  My parents think this is illegal.  Is it actually illegal?

This is in Iowa.

"Did I get scammed by applying to this job?. This is Washington State, US. 

I applied to work for a company called [Fun Flicks](http://funflicks.com/). It was a strange process to get this job. The interview was conducted outside and was really casual. It seemed too easy to get the job. It was an unusually small amount of time from application to being on board. Almost all of our communication has been via text, and I have not been shown the building they operate out of. I gave them my application with some sensitive information on it, that's all I am worried about. None of the information seemed out of the ordinary for a job application, but it is still concerning. They said I was 'on board' in May, and nothing happened after that besides some texting about the position. The last time we talked was a month ago. It all seems very odd. I can't even find one in Washington on Google maps. Either they are sort of unprofessional, or something sinister is afoot. What can I do to check the legitimacy of this company/job offer? Is there even a scam like this? Thanks",0
"Car Seat Laws in Greater Boston Area. Hello, 

I am from Korea where car seat laws are pretty lax. While most people choose to use car seats, there is no law requiring them, so many people will often just hold their babies in their laps while riding in taxis or buses, etc.

I'll be travelling to Boston and staying there for a month this fall, and I'm wondering about car seat rules for my one year old. I will be using a car seat for my everyday rental car, but what about taxis, commuter rail, subway, shuttle buses etc?

From what I read on the internet, it seems like Americans are really strict about car seat laws, so I don't want to do anything to upset CPS or the police. 

Will I be in legal trouble if I don't use a car seat on the taxi or shuttle bus at their airport. And what are the standards when travelling with a baby by subway or commuter rail? Is it okay to just hold the baby in my lap? 

I did do a quick google search which told me that car seats were not required on taxis, but I wasn't sure if the site was trustworthy.

I (25F) will be giving birth to a baby boy who is the offspring of my fiancé (31M) in September. Because we are not legally married yet, I have a few questions/concerns over medical legalities. 

Basically, I need to know the steps to take in case of something going wrong during birth. I'm assuming, as the father of my child, he would take over the decision making process for the baby if something were to happen to me. Would he have the same medical power of attorney over me if I were to have to be put in a coma or on a life support machine? Or would MPOA go automatically to my parents? I guess my questions are

-Do I need to file some sort of paperwork in case of an emergency with my life? 

-Do I need to have a will or some type of notarized paperwork giving him MPOA over our son? 

-Should I just inform my parents of my wishes in case of an emergency?

"How can I clear my warrant with as little to no jail time as possible?. I'd like to take care of my warrant from June 2016. The warrant is for failure to appear for a violation of probation for not showing up to probation (I'm on probation in a county 7 +hours away). 

I was convicted of domestic battery and sentenced to: 
60 days in jail 
3 years probation 
52 weekly classes 
Restitution 
Probation would have expired April 2017, but it has been revoked since June 2016. I believe that would make it 10 months left. 

Classes were finished October 2015, but I still owe most of the restitution. 

What kind of time am I looking at and what's the best way to minimize that?

Is it more likely they will entirely revoke probation and I serve out the max one year minus 60 days served?

"Cox cable wants to charge outrageous fees for new service (Virginia). I don't know if this would be better suited for a different /r/ but this was the first place I thought of.  In western Virginia (VA) We are building a house in a neighborhood that has been established for over a decade.

Cox cable is the only provider of internet in the neighborhood as far as I can tell.  After over 3 months of trying to get an answer over the phone I go in person to the store and they tell me it will be $6,700 to run a cable to my house.  They say the neighborhood is at capacity, and they will need to build a new node.  They *might* subsidize some of the cost, but would probably still be $3,000-$4,000 my cost, and I won't know the exact amount until they install.

Does anyone know if cable providers have an obligation to provide service in areas, or are they actually allowed to charge people these high fees to install infrastructure.  The house is 400 feet from a pole that has RG6 cable on it.

"Replacement Renter was denied, moved into my place anyway. (Nashville, TN). I am trying to move out of my apartment but my roommate is staying. His girlfriend was going to replace me on the lease but she was denied because her credit is only in the mid-low 600s.

She also has a steady full time job and only 6k in student loan debt. She thought that would make approval simple but not so. 

I am only told of her denial after apartment hunting and being approved for another apartment out of state and after she moved in all her stuff. They were trying to be slick and just move her in and hope no one cares or notices as long as my half of the rent continues getting paid.

"Workplace Sexual Harassment Question. Hey guys sorry for the anonymous, this is something I would rather not be tied too. That being said, here it goes.

I have worked for a city agency for 3 years now and for 2 or so of those years almost everyday people make sexual jokes about me or my sexual orientation, this ranges from my coworkers to my boss and even his boss, the second in command. The top dog does not know anything about it.

This all stemmed from a conversation about sexual experiences in the beginning of my employment.

Day in and day out jokes are made. For example: I got to work this morning and not even an hour later a joke about me being gay came up. This happens on average 3-6 times a day.

I know the second I say anything to them it will just make work suck even more.

I would rather not do anything since this is my only form income. I used to love doing what I do and I still do it just sucks being around the people that constantly make these jokes.

Do I have any recourse other than to just quit my job?

"Employer repeatedly fails to pay health insurance premium, causing insurance to terminate [usa-ca]. Hi,

My wife's employer pays for her health insurance. About a month ago, she had a routine doctors appointment. The doctor refused to see her since the insurance was terminated, unless she paid out of pocket. This also delayed her month prescription of medicine. Now she has a sudden sever pain in her neck, and she called her insurance to see what urgent care she should go to. They informed her that her policy was terminated again. This is very frustrating. Is this a legal or employment board issue? Someone told her to just go to the urgent care and send the bill to her boss. I think that is a bad idea. 

Her employer has never announced to the overall company that there has been nonpayment of the insurance premiums. For all we know, they have failed to make payments on time other months as well. My big concern is what if she was in a serious accident or had a sudden illness. We could be liable for all the charges and he full bill if that were to happen.

"Does being an independent contractor provide greater or lesser legal protection if company is sued?. I'm working with a company on an eCommerce site as general help (customer service, manufacturer communication, photos, etc.). 

It's a small business, and I'm helping out now with intent to hold equity in the future. The ownership arrangement is still pending (hasn't finished the ownership transfer/purchase document). Currently I'm taking a small monthly pay until equity is sorted out. 

Recently, the company owner is intending to file a lawsuit against a competitor. 

The owner suggested that I become an independent contractor formally (sent me a contract to sign) for the reason of legal protection. The reasoning for the formality is: as an independent contractor, any counter suits against the company after the litigation will not reach me as easily. 

I trust the company, but in research I've done online, I've become worried this might not provide me the best protection in counter suits.

"I want to use some Vimeo videos for a non-profit film festival fundraiser - what do I need to do?. Hi. An organization I work with, a 501(c)3 nonprofit serving homeless populations, wants to hold a 'film showcase' that engages the general public about homelessness with films/videos on the topic. There are about four videos on Vimeo we found that would be perfect - each about 4-7 minute-long shorts. 

The event will be held at a local movie theater in town, and I had some hesitation on this because they all thought it would be fine just to show the videos without a problem. I told them we might need permission for something like this, and they gave me the task of figuring this out. This showcase has a cost to attend - with the ticket price benefiting the nonprofit; a meal/drink is included in the cost.

What are the legalities of something like this? I feel like I need to contact the production companies, ask for their permission, and get it in writing. But is it simpler than that? More complex? I appreciate any guidance on this subject.

I contacted my property manager multiple times a month since the end of March, each time being told that there were ""higher priority repairs"" and that he would get to it as soon as he could. The last time I spoke with him (June 25th) he said he has a crew scheduled to come out July 5th and finally fix it. It is July 12th and no one has come out. 


I haven't had access to my balcony that I am paying for since March 3rd, which is over 5 months. Am I entitled to compensation or a rent reduction?",1
"(NYC) New lease after 30 day notice and complication one holdover. My roommate and I are on a month to month lease after our original 12 month expired. We both want to stay because it's an awesome place. Without details, a recent incident resulted in agreement between myself and the landlord that the roommate should go. The roommate has suggested (many months ago) that he would be a pain in the ass and be a holdover, and stretch out the legal process, if given notice.

Our lease says that if we are given a 30 day notice to vacate, and we holdover, the rent doubles. 

Would it be possible for me to sign a new lease without the current roommate starting after that 30 days and for me not to be considered a holdover? If so, and he decided to be a holdover, can I still occupy? Would he then be charged double rent of our original agreement even though there is a new lease and lesser rent is being paid through that lease? 

Please note, this is more or less trying to figure out my worst case scenario, not all what I'm hoping for. Ideally he will just move out in fear of double rent.",1
"Received check from FTC due to DeVry Lawsuit. Hi. I am from Northern New Jersey. I am in need of some advice and was wondering if the helpful people of this subreddit can provide some. Throwaway being used for anonymity. A couple of days ago, I received a check from the Federal Trade Commission because they settled with DeVry in a 100 million dollar settlement. After doing hours of research and spending hours on the phone with government student loan help lines I am lost. I want to know a few things. Does cashing this check stop me from filing a lawsuit against DeVry? Also, I still owe around $60,000 in Student Loans, with this settlement anyone with Private Student loans are being refunded but people like me who took out Federal Student Loans are left to seek out other means of refund. One suggestion from the FTC was filing for the  Department of Education's Borrower Defense to Repayment program. Should I do this before seeing an attorney? I am afraid that if Betsy DeVos gets her way she will get rid of this program before it can help me out. Any advice? Please and thank you.",0
"Question on Statute of Limitations for personal injury in Illinois. Almost ten years ago, I took a Jiu Jitsu class at the local YMCA. 

During a drill on a basic technique, the girl I was paired with broke her arm after falling awkwardly. It was a spider guard technique, done under the supervision of the teacher. Not a submission or anything, just a freak accident. Minor break, i'm not sure of the details of her injury. 

This will come into play later.

A few classes later, my teacher has a friend come in and practice with us. A blue belt in akido. He, the teacher, insists I practice with this person, and my hand gets broken during this practice. 

I recently found out that the person was the girl's boyfriend. and he broke my hand on purpose. 

Is there anything I can do? The true cause of the injury wasn't known until this year. 

I know the statute of limitations is up for personal injury, 2 years, but considering that I didn't find out the true cause until recently, would the 'clock' start when I found out this information? 

Is there anything I can do legally at this point?",0
"Home builder making claims that are not explicitly stated in the contract. I am currently in the process of buying a new home from a builder. When we first started the process, they told us that there were incentives to go with their preferred lender. For example, some incentives were a free separate tub and shower, $5000 in studio upgrades, and a couple of other smaller items. I along with a family friend who works with home loans thoroughly read through the contract, we could not find where these incentives are tied to the preferred lender. Both the lender and the salesman have told us since the beginning have told us that these incentives were tied with the preferred lender so if we didn't go with the preferred lender, we would lose the incentives. I am sure they have also told others this and it does not seem to be true after reading the contract. This may have kept us along with many other home buyers from getting the best deal on their mortgage. Would there be any grounds to sue here? If so, what would the next steps in the process be? Any information is appreciated. Thanks.",1
"Check fraud - cashed a bad check unknowingly. So my son's friend, ""Jimmy"", told my son, ""Fred"", that Jimmy's gramma wrote my son a check for $250 so that my son could cash it and hand the money over to his friend.  So my son did that.  Fred found out Monday that Jimmy forged his gramma's signature.  Jimmy's parents stopped over today and said that my son has until Saturday to pay them back or they will call the cops.  My son has text messages confirming his story...that he did not know the check was bad and that he confronted Jimmy about it and ended up dumping him over it.  Very adequate proof but...

1. What legal responsibility does my son have here if he had no knowledge of the check's legitimacy?  

2.  Does he have to pay Jimmy's parents the money?  

3.  Is he otherwise legally responsible?  

He even, in good faith, went to the bank today but they only him to ask an attorney.

Note: My son has done some dumb things in the past but this one is certainly believable because of his text message proof so I'm very inclined to believe him.  Just felt I had to say that on his behalf.",0

"Considering taking in a 16 year old in need of place to stay. I was recently approached by a friend asking if my husband and I could room a 16 year old who's family is about to be evicted. How legal is this? 

Background: We are in Pennsylvania. teen in question has a mother who is frivolous with money. Spent rent money on other things. They are about to be evicted. My friend knows the teen and is trying to find them a temporary home in their school area. Which is where we come in. He asked us if we could take on just the teen, not the mother. 'Worst case' they'd be staying with us a year. 

We have spare room, but little money so the teen would effectively be paying 'rent'- even though we'd only be taking some money for their food and a little for the extra electricity (AC, computer, what have you). 

As they are a minor and not emancipated, how legal is this? We want to help the kid but not if it'll fuck us and them over in the long run. I know some states you can get in trouble for harboring a runaway, although as far as I can tell the mother would be aware of their location.

"Girlfriend was assaulted this past weekend, need advice on how to proceed. My girlfriend went out to a casino this past Saturday night with a group of work friends. Apparently one of the guys in the group was annoyed at my girlfriend for getting cigarette smoke in his face. According to her, he grabbed her by the back of her neck and slammed her down onto the sidewalk. She came home with nasty gashes on her face and forehead. She's asleep at the moment, but as far as I know police were not called and she declined medical attention. An employee of the casino had her sign some sort of waiver which I'm assuming said she wouldn't bring legal action against the casino. 

I have no interest in bringing action against the casino but in the morning I'm going to see if she will file a police report against the guy that did this to her. I also believe that the casino will have video surveillance of the incident as well as a copy of the waiver she signed. Will we need to file with the police who have jurisdiction over the area the casino was in? Looking for any advice on how to proceed...

Thank you",0
"Moved out of rental home and was charged $9000 in repairs. It is a laughable number. This is in addition to the $1200 deposit they're keeping. We left the house in good condition, given we had lived in a 5 person roommate situation for 3 years. We weren't expecting the full deposit back, but were hopeful for a couple hundred bucks or so. Any holes or dents were nicely patched, we steamcleaned the carpets, professionally cleaned the empty house, pressure washed the garage floor and every concrete patio, cleaned the gutters....you get the gist. The repairs they are charging us for are absurd and unreasonable. 
What options do we have to go against this? They are threatening to send the debt to collections if we dont pay within 30 days. There are 2 names on the lease, do we each get that debt? Is this one of those things that they throw out an insanely high number and settle for way leas later? Does renters insurance help with this at all?

"Government given to unqualified friend. I was recently passed over for a job at state agency. The choice was between myself, who I believe to be well-qualified for the position, and another individual, who did not meet the minimum qualifications to apply for the job, but is a friend of the person in charge of hiring for the position. 

Of course, I will not take any formal action, as I have a professional reputation to protect. But I do have a long-standing professional/personal relationship with the person who was in charge of hiring, so I am considering asking for a private meeting to discuss how I feel that the hiring practice was unethical and seems to be based on personal relationships and not professional qualifications. 

My question is, despite being unethical, is there anything illegal about this situation? How was this competitor even able to make it past the screening process without the minimum education and certifications? Surely there should be safeguards in place at the state HR office to prevent individuals in positions of power from hiring friends versus hiring for merit?",0

I texted her the day before asking for a 30min meet. I intended to meet her at this point. In the morning she didnt reply and I assumed it was off, it was only an hour before she confirmed.

By doing this the road no longer touched our property so the state/county cut us a driveway from the new road to our property for ingress and egress. There was no paperwork on this other than the fact that the road was reconfigured. 
So, in the state of Georgia, one legally acquires a prescriptive easement after 20 years of use through the neighbors property, thus giving us the right to use the road. The neighbor never said anything about us using the driveway for 50 years until he caught wind that I was about to build a house there. Now all of the sudden he has a problem with us using the driveway. We are currently set to go to court in September and all indications point toward us winning the civil suit. Are there any holes in my case for the prescriptive easement?",1
"[INT] Copyright claim over Amigurumi (crochet plush). My SO (we are in the UK) crochets amigurumi plushies, and sells them on etsy, as a side hobby (by no means does she really EARN from it per se).

One of her listings on etsy is a pattern for an animal amigurumi, which she posted in the last month. Today she received an email from another etsy seller (from Canada) telling her to take it down as she is infringing on her copyright, as she also has a pattern for the same animal on etsy, and has done since 2016.

the seller notes that she can tell the patterns are not identical, as the stitches are clearly different (at least from a crocheters perspective), but cites that the finished amigurumi is still very similar in appearance, and thus this is where her copyright has been infringed.

is this a thing?

this woman literally says ""Copyright laws protect the appearance of an amigurumi design, even if the actual pattern isn't identical"".

i know my SO didn't copy her pattern, or even use images of her amigurumi for the inspiration. it is purely coincidental. this isn't the first pattern she's made by herself.",0
"I need to cancel my hotel room in Dublin for May 2018 but they want to charge me a cancellation fee around the same price as the room and say there's nothing else I can do. What are my options?. So I'll try and keep this brief...basically I booked a hotel room in Dublin for my gf and I for her birthday. On booking.com it said Free Cancellation; an option I wanted as I was trying to get tickets to concert in another City but thought Dublin would work as back-up. I booked the room but hadn't realised there was a specific option for free cancellation rooms so when i tried to cancel I was told it would be 150EUR, 25EUR more than the price of the room and they are refusing to cancel it.  If I hadn't given enough notice to cancel the room I would've understood, but the booking is 10 months away.  They are taking the payment next week but I've just noticed that my recorded credit card details are incorrect (I try to memorize my card numbers and I mixed up the numbers on the front and back of 2 different cards)..when they try to charge can I just refuse to pay or from a legal stand point can they demand the money?",0
"I believe i was abused by my school - Ontario. This happened several years ago, when I was about 13 years old. 

I verbally threatened to kill a classmate. I was just a dumb 13 year old, and no reasonable person should have taken me seriously.

My school principal told me that I would get an 80 day suspension, but yet she never contacted my parents. And I never told my parents because I didnt want them to know.

Then, for the next 2 weeks, monday to Friday I was instructed to sit in an uncomfortable wooden chair and do nothing at all for the whole day every day. This is 9 am to 3 pm, sitting in a chair doing nothing but staring at a wall for 10 days. (2 weeks). Nobody to talk to and nothing to do but look at the wall.

This is 60 hours of isolation. I felt like a prisoner in those isolation things. 

Then abruptly, she told me that my punishment is done. I never received any paperwork or documentation of anything at all. I found her reaction incredibly harsh.

Was I morally abused? 
Is there any legal action that should have been taken at the time?
Is there any legal action that can be taken now, year later?",0
"My friend drove drunk and got raped. Can she get in trouble for the drunk driving if she wants to report the rape?. My friend [F25] was out drinking at bar with a few friends and acquaintances over this past weekend. She drove home very drunk and one of her ""friends"" followed her home and raped her in her apartment. 


I want my friend to go to the police and file a report against this scum bag so he doesn't find another drunk victim to rape, because I just don't think this was his first time. She doesn't want to go to the police because she drove home drunk and is afraid of the consequences. Can she get charged with a DUI or a misdemeanor if she admits that she drove home drunk without any incidents? If we find out that it's unlikely, then I think she'll agree to file a report of rape against this guy. Once that question is mostly answered, we need to find out if there's enough ""evidence"" of the rape to actually do anything. She's really worried that it'll just be her word against his. 

Thank you for any help/advice on this issue. It's such a sensitive situation and she nor I knew where to turn to for help.",0
"I need to get my toxic and narcissistic roommate out as soon as possible.. USA - Colorado

I'll try and keep it short and to the point. I'll try not to rant, but I can't make any promises lol.

He doesn't follow a single rule that I told him when he first moved in. He's stealing my beer and is only 20. He got fired from his job because he refused to do his job on a daily basis. He violates my personal space all the time and I can't take it. He gets angry very easily and treats me like a doormat even though I pay most the rent. I've given him so many chances to redeem himself, but he simply refuses.

I told him I wanted him out in 30 days. Right now it's only been 12, but his behavior is getting extremely worse and I'm tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own home. **He's not on the lease** and I wanted to know if it's possible to get him out sooner. I was told by numerous people I legally have to give him 30 days, but I need to know if I can get him out sooner before things get worse.

Is it legally required to give him 30 days to move out in Colorado? He's not on the lease and didn't even pay rent this month.",1
Former roommates are refusing to return our portion of the initial deposit for an apartment and have now blocked us on all social media.. I'm looking for advice on what action I should take. Myself and my girlfriend shared an apartment with another couple one of whom I have been long term friends with. They handled all the financials and we simply paid them what was needed. Two months after our lease ended they are refusing to pay us back our deposit. We have reached out to them several times and received multiple text confirmations of their intention to return our money. Our phone numbers have been blocked as well as social media. The amount totals about $600. I have venmo and bank transfer receipts and texts that confirm every transaction as well as their intent to return our money. On top of everything we sold them a couch set for a verbally agreed $150 that has also not been paid. I'm childhood friends with this person which is why I never asked for any money up front. We had a falling out shortly after moving but I never expected them to steal from me. I'm incredibly overwhelmed. Is there anything I can do?,1
"Landlord expects me to temporarily move out for 1 week of my lease term while I still pay rent. As many of you know, Augusta is home to the Masters Golf tournament, which occurs during the first week in April. I am currently renting a room in a four bedroom house. My landlord also happens to live in one of the bedrooms. 

A provision in my lease states that I have to temporarily move out for the first week in April so that the homeowner can rent out the house for the Masters. This involves me moving all of my personal belongings, an endeavor that will be extremely time consuming. 

I had no issues with this provision when I signed  the lease because I believed that the rent / utilities for that month would be prorated to reflect my absence during Masters Week. However, I have come find out that my landlord expects me to pay my rent in full for April, as well as the utilities in full during this month while she simultaneously profits of both me and her Masters Week guests and effectively renders me homeless for the week. 

I do not believe this is fair at all. Do I have any legal recourse in the state of Georgia?",1
"Friend owes me $2,000. Need advice for sensitive circumstances. I will spare you the lengthy story of how my friend came about owing me $2,000. (Please spare me your opinions of how I shouldn't share my Paypal or the quality of the friendship) 

He agrees that he unintentionally took this money from a shared Paypal account and I have records to prove the money is mine and went into his personal bank account. He has agreed to pay me back the money, however he is doing it very slowly. In the last 6 months I have received $400 in payments from him. His reasoning for infrequent payments is that his dad is battling cancer and all his income is going towards hospital bills. 
I have kindly asked him to increase the frequency to $200/month and since then I have not received any money in over 1 month. 

Should I take legal matters to the small claims court? If so, how do I approach that without being aggressive (How do I tell 
 him this before filing)?

"[CA] Father wants me to pay my student loans that are in his name. I'm 3 years into college and didn't know about this arrangment.. Hello, I'm an out-of-state student attending a UC campus. My father makes upwards of 500k annually as an entrepreneur and lobbyist, while I work a minimum wage retail job over summers. Naturally, I did not qualify for any need-based aid, so we had to take out a Parent Direct PLUS loan each year to cover the majority of expenses. I was under the impression that, since my father makes so much money, that he'd pay off all these loans, even moreso because the loans are entirely in his name and the FAFSA website says that the debt of these loans cannot be traditionally transferred to the child.

I just recently learned that he has been telling everyone, except me, that he was only going to provide 15k annually while I would pay off the loans myself. All my family believe his side of the story because that is all they were told. Is it possible that he could sue to somehow transfer the debt? Does him telling everyone that I'm paying for it help such a case? In general, what should I do here?",0
"[US] Can my ex-employer sue me for speaking out about retaliation?. Hello legaladvice peeps,

In 2016, I worked for a smallish tech company with a whole host of problems, including sexual harassment, unequal pay given to employees with the same responsibilities, internal nepotism, etc etc. I was asked by a journalist to speak on these problems, in particular about how several employees banded together to bargain for an HR representative and equal pay for the same work. 

I spoke to the journalist already, but I've negotiated anonymity and am debating going on-record. The thing is, I signed an NDA, and I'm not sure if it's enforceable in this instance. I can send a copy of it privately if you're curious. But this article will come out within the time period specified by the NDA (2 years). My question is, can an NDA protect against claims of employer retaliation? AFAIK, that's not a business strategy, intellectual property, or anything of the like. It's just how I was treated by my employer, and as far as I can tell, collective bargaining is a federally protected action.

Anyway, any help would be appreciated, here.",0
"Just moved into an apartment. There is a cockroach problem that was not disclosed to me prior. What are my rights?. This is in Florida. 
I just moved into an apartment. It is the same apartment complex I was already living in, but another building. My old apartment had no issues with bugs. The current apartment has a cockroach problem. I've seen 5 already on my first day and 3 on my second day. I noticed there is a giant tree right near the property and cockroaches on the stairs. I asked to install a weather strip under the door because there wasn't one. I thought that would take care of the problem but it hasn't. A neighbor told me the person below me is a hoarder and that may be an issue, but the management told me they can't come in from another apartment. 

Anyway, my point is, what are my legal rights here and how much time do I have to exercise them and how do I exercise them? I am going to write them an email stating the problem and requesting pest control come to spray and management come to inspect, seal off wherever they're coming from. If that fails, am I within my legal rights to end the lease?

"[interstate taxes] State of LA has put a hold on my financial aid money. I think I need a lawyer?. I got an email from my bank saying that Louisiana Dept of Revenue put a hold on my account. I'm living on student loans and financial aid right now so a hold means I have no income until fall aid comes in. Do I need a lawyer or is this something I should try to handle myself? I'm not sure how to go about getting a lawyer either since I live in another state. Do I need a LA lawyer or can a lawyer in my state (NV) help me? NV doesn't have state taxes so I'm not sure if I could find one here that deals with this sort of thing. I also have no money now so I'm not sure if they'd even listen to me.

The worst part is that I think it has to be some kind of mistake. I never owed money on my tax returns at any point while I lived there. I mostly worked low paying jobs. The only thing I can think is that one year I didn't file with them because I couldn't afford the state filing fee. The refund wasn't much so I figured I'd just let them keep it. Could that be why they are saying I owe? I'm really confused and not sure what to do.",0

Well, I found my roommate and she did not sign anything and we just had an oral agreement where she gave me a 250$ deposit.

She told me she'd get someone to fit for her and I was ok with that. Fast forward a couple of days. She left to go somewhere and forgot to shut her bedroom door. I noticed then that she only got a piece of lighter colored carpet and simply placed it under the old carpet.

"[Louisiana] Man has lights, cameras pointed into my private backyard. Trespassed into my yard via ladder.. This is not my first time posting this, but since it keeps getting worse and worse I need help. 

There is a man who lives behind me who is a nuisance to everyone around him. He puts very bright lights up that always go on at sunset, off at dawn. 

He put lights up pointed directly at my house, above my privacy fence, and onto my bedroom window. I'm under 18, live with my parents, and they don't know what to do or they are too lazy to help.

"My landlord rented me an apartment that can't legally be rented by issue of the fire marshall. I moved into an apartment in Kalamazoo Michigan last June, and this month my job wanted to transfer me to a different city, so I began the process of finding someone to sublease. My landlord made me aware that there had been a fire here and that's why the last tenant left. What they didn't tell me was that the fire marshall had told them that they could not legally rent this apartment because it's too close to the fence next door. There are two large fences, a chain-link and a wooden one running right along the side of the apartment. According to the mire marshall, that can't be that way if they're going to have someone living here.

"Knowing if you have recourse with a landlord in Boulder, CO. Myself and three friends signed a lease for a 3 bedroom downstairs apartment earlier this year.

In addition, the construction will not be done until 4 days after our move in date.

It seems strange that the landlords want us to pay them the full month's rent when the apartment will only be under their ownership for one day of August.  We are slightly afraid that they will simply keep the money.  

What's the best course of action?

The penalty for not paying rent on time in our lease is very minimal.",1
"Would an Alberta​ court (in Canada) enforce an Ontario court's ruling for Small Claims?. Hi r/legaladvice,

I have a question regarding the enforcement of a judge's ruling, and provincial jurisdictions in Canadian courts for small claims.

So to give some short background info, I want to file a case in Small Claims Court against an ex-girlfriend who I lent a lump sum of money to for a week. It's been years and she refuses to pay me back, so I want to go the legal route to get my money back from her.

The issue is that I live in Ontario (whereas she now lives in Alberta) and would like to file the case here, in an Ontario court. The incident also happened in Ontario, so the courts here will accept the case. The problem is that if a judge rules in my favour and she must pay me back, they can't enforce the ruling in Alberta where she lives now, because it's out of their jurisdiction.

So the person I spoke to for information in the Ontario Small Claims Court said I should find out if Alberta courts will enforce rulings made by Ontario courts? I did a lot of online research and couldn't find an answer, so would anyone here know if they would?",0
"NJ - How long does the state have to produce discovery before I can successfully motion for a dismissal?. Hi all, got arrested for possession of marijuana under 50g. I requested discovery including the dash cam footage, (what they sent me isnt even video from my arrest, it's of some other traffic stop that isn't me) and of course lab results. I am hoping that the lab results will take a long time to come back and eventually the court will be pressed to dismiss the case. 
It is actually a significant prejudice to me having to take off of work for the morning only court and drive 1.5 hours away to this courthouse. 
In addition to all this, I also received a ticket in the mail for possession of CDS in a vehicle, signed 34 days after the initial arrest. It is my understanding that there is a 30 day statute of limitations for traffic violations , therefore I am submitting a motion to dismiss that ticket. 

I am representing myself pro se, and would like to know basically how long is reasonable enough to wait for lab results before I ask for dismissal, and is there in fact a 30 day statute of limitations for traffic tickets? 

Thank you all in advanced!",0
"[Ontario, Canada] Signing a buyers representation agreement with two agents?. We are in Ontario Canada and have been looking at places in Toronto, Ontario and Windsor, Ontario.

We signed one buyers representation agreement with an agent in the Toronto area when we were looking to lease a place in Toronto. We just moved to Toronto on July 1st and ended up finding a place without the agent.

The agent marked on file that he is helping us out for the Toronto central, east and west area. He says he only works in the Toronto area and Windsor is about 4 to 5 hours drive away.

In Windsor we are signing with another agent and purchased offer was accepted yesterday evening.

Today we are planning to send acknowledgment forms, sign buyer representation with the Windsor agent and so on.

I am wondering if there will be any problem with the previous agent trying to take the new ones commission or anything.

Any info helps!

"(MN, US) Need help ""evicting"" someone from my house.. Okay, so about a month and a half ago, my boyfriend's friend asked if he could crash on our couch for ""a few days"" because he was homeless and broke and whatever. We said sure, as long as it was only for a few days, because we live in subsidized housing and it is against our lease to have someone stay for an extended period of time. He has been here for over a month now, and we don't know how to get him out. I am posting here because I was telling someone about this situation and how I was thinking about printing a fake letter from my landlord and using that as a way to get him to leave, and I was told that in Minnesota if someone has been staying in a house for a certain period of time they need to be formally evicted. I don't know how true that is, or what to do. We have asked him to leave and he just tells us ""I have nowhere else to go"" even though he has other friends with couches that he could be mooching off of. Sorry if anything is unclear, I am a little frazzled.   

TL;DR Guy is staying on our couch and will not leave, he doesn't pay rent and isn't on the lease. How do I get rid of him?",1
"Fees and charges for cancellation of water cooler service (New York). Hi, our business entered into a 3 year, $35/month bottleless water cooler contract with a local provider. Due to dissatisfaction with the service (the machine has needed service several times and not enough water is cooled at any given time), we would like to cancel. 

The provider has offered to change the machine. Otherwise, the contract provides for a $150 removal fee in the event of cancellation. It also says, ""If provider terminates a rental term under this Agreement or any Add-on Schedule due to Customer’s default, including but not limited to, non-payment of any amount when due, improper care, usage or handling of the Equipment, or failure to perform any other obligation hereunder, Customer will be responsible for payment of all fees for the remaining term(s), as well as for all damages and removal and shipping charges incurred by provider.""

"Can I kick out my roommate?. I live in CO. I have a roommate who is subletting for another roommate who moved to Nevada for a job offer. This roommate is not on the lease and the subletting roommate foolishly didn't have her sign anything regarding the room she would stay in. Our lease is up the 31st of July and she has not paid rent, has eaten our food (we have proof), has thrown away and broken our dishes (have proof), and has no job or even made an attempt to find a job. She also has a history of mental illness, stealing, hurting herself and other people according to her friends and family.

"NYC Rental / Quality of Life issues. Any ideas on how to resolve with landlord?. I am helping a client who has multiple issues with her “rent stabilized apartment” (so trying to help her solve instead of her moving). The apartment is located in a 5 story mixed use building. She lives in the rear on the first floor and the first two apartments are medical offices.

The receptionist and some of the patients smoke in the hallway and/or the front stoop of the building. This smokes permeates into my client’s apartment. She requested from the manager (one person who works for various small landlords) that he place a NO SMOKING sign in the lobby. He refused stating “the landlord would not want that.”

Additionally, there is a noise issue. Again my client is on the first floor and both the patients and other residents will linger on the first floor (hallway) or the front of the building to chat at night (as late as 1:30am). The walls are so thin as are the windows that she hears everything and is awakened at night.

What, if anything, can she do (other than move) – because this, to me would constitute a constructive eviction. Thank you in advance.",1
"Denied warranty claims due to cosmetic damage despite my mobile device malfunction. I have a plan with a telco company that is akin to mobile device insurance. I get to replace my defective set for a new/refurbished set with a small out-of-pocket charge ($130). The device that I would receive is covered under a 6 months warranty.

5 months in the warranty, said device started malfunctioning. I tried to exercise the warranty but it was out rightly denied on the basis that there is cosmetic damage on the device (small dent).

I disputed this on the basis that no where on the service terms and conditions did it explicitly state that cosmetic damage voids this 6-months warranty. 

The warranty clause is as such: 

Warranty – You are entitled to a 6 month warranty for each Like Mobile Device against manufacturer malfunctions and defects that starts from the date of delivery of Like Mobile Device. }

They claim that my cosmetic damage is ""against manufacturer malfunctions"" hence my warranty is void. So far I have spoken to two senior managers who have given me the same reasoning.

"I'm 35 years old and never filed a tax return (USA). I'll cut right to the chase here:

My first job was at 18 years old. Between the ages of 18 and 31 I've spent maybe 5 years earning minimum wage at temp agencies, fast food restaurants, a law firm (doing data entry) and a home theater installation company. There were taxes withheld from those paychecks.

Much of the rest of the time I was unemployed. I also went to school full time during many (too many) of those years. My parents helped me make ends meet during a lot of that time. I also spent about one year running an eBay business, but this was about 15 years ago, at a time when ebay and paypal didn't report anything to the IRS.

I live in another country now, and have been for about 4 years. I don't earn enough to be required to pay taxes to the IRS. The threshold is about $90k USD.

December of last year I worked for a studio in Los Angeles, CA for a week making outfits for a commercial.

The man recently missed a payment, then immediately after declared Personal Bankruptcy. The collections agencies for his now null and void $500,000 debt are attempting to seize his house and sell it to pay some of the debt off, while my Grandmother wants to foreclose on the property herself so that she can re-sell it as the property's value has increased by about 30% during the last 5 years.

"Breaking lease over faulty/insufficient AC unit [US, KS]. In my apartment, maintenance has been out a few times to fix the AC. As it stands, midwest summer has kicked into full gear and it's not unusual for my apartment to exceed 80 degrees, occasionally getting to the upper eighties at peak heat. While I work in hot environments and so have built up a resistance to the heat, I have a 10 month old who is having more trouble with it. A quick googling shows that most experts say infants should be kept at about 72 degrees when sleeping, so getting above eighty seems to be not recommended. It's especially bad at night, when he is sleeping, as even then the apartment stays around eighty and keeps him fairly restless.

My question is, under Kansas law, when does this become an unlivable residence and I can lawfully break the lease? My research is showing these things to be a bit obtuse, and I'm not sure if having a young child in the apartment makes any difference. I've been more or less told that the AC is working as hard as it can and that there's just not much more that can be done. Am in good standing with the landlord, if that helps the legal situation at all.

"(CT) - One Last Question Regarding Small Claims Suit Against Landlord!. We are suing our former landlord for the return of our security deposit. In CT, you can claim double damages. However, we have some charges that we do agree with that were taken out of our security deposit. Let's say the total deposit was $1200.00 and the charges that we are not disputing equal $400.00. In filling out the paperwork, there is a spot to put the amount you are claiming and then a box to check off if you are claiming double damages. The paperwork specifically says not to include the double security deposit in that box, but I need to claim the amount in the area where I write my complaint. So, I have a few questions:

1. Do I put the full amount of the security deposit in the box where it says amount claimed ($1200.00)? Or do I put the amount of the security deposit minus the charges we are not disputing($800.00)?

2. When putting in the amount for double damages, do I subtract the charges before or after I double the amount. For example, would I claim $2000 ($1200 x 2 = $2400 - $400 = $2000), or would I claim $1600 ($1200-$400 = $800 x 2 = $1600)?

So I'm wondering if this would be my best option or is there some way I can deal with this myself without having to get an attorney? Maybe a public defender? I'd like to not have this on my record but I'm mainly worried about this warrant. I'm currently trying to find an apartment in Colorado and I feel like this is definitely going to cause problems when I start applying. As it is I don't have very much money so paying an attorney 1000 on top of whatever other costs I'll have is going to be hard. Should I call the Albuquerque court house and try to deal with this myself or will that just make things worse? Thanks for reading and any advice is much appreciated.",0
"Caught by police having sex (both adults) in a parking lot at night.... seemed to be ""off the hook"" but would like to confirm?. Happened in Utah, USA.

To begin, yes I learned my lesson. Won't be happening again. 

Basically what happened is, at night my SO and I decided to drive out to a seemingly secluded place. We found a parking lot for a hiking trail that was empty. We did the deed, and then as we were putting clothes back on an officer approached the car. 

We decided the best plan of action was to come clean. And so we did. 

He asked us both basic questions (""Are you here on your own free will, did you consent to the activities taken place"") and looked at both of our IDs.

Then he just came back and said ""yeah, just find a better place to do this next time, go home tonight."" He didn't say ""you're under arrest"" either. 

No alcohol was involved. We are both adults. 

Am I off the hook? Was I unknowingly charged with anything? He didn't mention anything like an arrest or a citation or anything like that. Did he jus need our IDs to confirm our birthdays or are we going to get citations?

I feel like I'm kinda off the hook but I can never be too sure.

"[CA] Minor filing claim for small claims court.. Located in California. Last year I was involved in a small car accident where the other party had rear ended me. For several months, the other party was unreachable according to his insurance, only to suddenly then inform me that I was at fault and that they will not pay. I am currently in the process of filing a claim but I have some questions as I was/am under 18. 
- What exactly does appointing a ""guardian ad litem"" mean for me? Am I still allowed to present the case in court on my own?
 According to official websites, I must be appointed a ""guardian ad litem"" who will represent me since I am a minor. My parents have limited English and it would be preferred for me to present the case.
- Is it possible to charge the defendant for costs of a rental car while the damaged car is being repaired? I have the intention of squeezing out as much as possible since the other party has caused an inconvenience for me and my family. If possible, how would I go about including the costs for a rental car?

So far, those are the only questions I have come across filling out the paperwork. Any other tips and advice would be greatly appreciated!",0
"Unofficial sublease is 2 weeks late on rent and is ignoring my texts and calls about it.. Location: Tippecanoe County, Indiana (West Lafayette, zip code 47906)

Hello fellow Redditers,

I am having an issue with a girl I subleased my apartment to. It is an unofficial sublease and management does not know about it. There is a clause in the lease stating unofficial subleases are not allowed.

Basically what is happening is my tenant is 2 weeks late on rent and is avoiding any questions about it. I paid rent to my landlord, but have not been reimbursed for it. She is also ignoring my calls and texts, or says she is at work and cannot take my calls. She also lacks the common courtesy to return my calls once she gets off work. I have no idea what to do in this situation.  

Additionally, the lease ends on August 2nd 2017 and if she is not moved out and has the keys turned in to the management, there is a $250 a day holdover charge. What options do I have to fix this situation? 

There are agreements that have been made over text that I have a record of. However, I need advice on how to handle this predicament currently, and possibly legally in the future.

Thank you for your advice!",1
"[NC] Small claims court inquiry.. * Answered an ad on social media that offered paint correction on vehicles. The guy had ample pictures of his work(or so I thought lol) etc.

* Well he gets the car &amp; proceeds to paint it with what's looks to be a paint brush &amp; a roller. He lays the paint that looks to be house paint on so thick it never completely dried. Rendering all sorts of debris embedded, including I kid you not a butterfly stuck to the hood not unlike a hood ornament lol. There were gobs of paint on the glass, floor carpeting &amp; the chrome work.

* I contacted him several times afterwards only to get a run around &amp; he finally deleted all of his social media pages. He's also an active duty marine, so I don't know if they have a different/ faster venue other than small claims court.

* I had the car repaired &amp; the negligent work ended up costing me double what it would have prior to the botched work. I have an itemized invoice from the body shop detailing the flawed repair as well as ample pics.

* I'm seeking the money it cost me to rectify the damage caused by the improper repair. Should I file for ""Money Owed"" or ""Property Damage"".

[CT] Roomate singed lease wont pay rent. Has left premises.. So originally two other people and i signed a lease for a year for a 2 bedroom appartment. Everyone was moving in but day one x roomate decided they were not living there. The door had accidentally become locked overnight while they were moving in and they werent able to get in the first night. I fixed the issue the following morning and made fresh keys for everyone. X roomate stated they no longer wished to stay there. I had recieved their secirity deposit and first months rent. However there is a clause stating that any roomate that leaves needs to one: give 2 months notice and two: find a suitable replacement for their vacant position. X roomate is trying to claim their bedroom isnt a legal living space and therefor doesnt need to pay rent anymore. They havnt been to the building since day one. This roomate had ample time to inspect and see the space and still signed the lease and knew what they were getting into. The room itself is a finished attic room with stairs however they might not be up to code. Any advice is incredibly appreciated. I was planning on taking them to small claims court if i have a legal right to.,1
"[MI] Rebuilding motorcycle, odometer question (x-post from r/motorcycles). My husband is combining separate components of two 85 Honda Nighthawk 650s to make the best of the two bikes. Bike A's engine seized, but is otherwise in great condition for an 85. Bike B has an engine in excellent mechanical shape, but the forks need swapped, the gas tank is dented, etc. 

There is a slight concern that we have. Bike B's gauge cluster is busted and the speedometer doesn't work. Bike A's gauge cluster is cosmetically and functionally the better part. The issue is that Bike A only has 15k miles, while bike B has 26k miles. If we put A's cluster on B's frame, it would show 11k miles less than are actually on the frame and engine. 

What is the correct way to proceed? Should we swap the odometers and disclose to the DMV that the mileage is incorrect? Should we crack open the gauge cluster and roll it to the correct mileage? Should we just forget about swapping the cluster entirely? We're trying to be as honest as we can with the bike. 

His intention is to keep the resulting bike once it's fixed up and scrapping the rest of the parts, but may sell it eventually when he's a more experienced rider.",0
"Apartment has become unsafe. Hello everyone. July of last year my fiance and I moved into this duplex. It's really nice &lt; 3 years old, we're the second tennants. However since we've moved in we've had problem after problem with things breaking, including the A/C. We live in Georgia, so that's a problem. About 3 months ago, I awoke to the smell of smoke, as a firefighter I didn't call 911 and decided to investigate first. Turns out our light fixture above the sink was smoking pretty bad,  I removed the bulb amd it seemed to stop. Maintenance put a new bulb in, and it went out shortly after. We decided to leave it alone. Our A/C went out saturday night. We got by Sunday with the help of a window unit until they fixed it monday. Well about 45 minutes ago, my fiance woke me up screaming that the house was smoking, sure enough the control panel was extremely hot, and putting off a good amount of smoke I removed the panel, shutting it off. I checked the breaker, and it too was hot. Had we not been here I am about 90% certain it would have led to a house fire. 

What are my rights as a tenant to terminate the lease if I feel unsafe? Will lawers have to get involved?

"Homeownership when moving someone into a nursing home (Virginia). So a little background my dad is 77, a widow.  He had a heart attack about 18 months ago and now was diagnosed with Parkinsons at the beginning of 2017.  

I am his only child, his will is updated since my mom's death so everything goes to me.  He owns the home he lives in free and clear and it's worth about $180,000.

My wife keeps  nagging me to have the ownership of the home transferred from him to me.  Her belief is that if he have to put him in a nursing home at some point, that they will come after the home.  She believes this because her mother has told her this for years and is what they did to ""protect"" their grandparents home.  

From my reading, if he was placed in a nursing home his medicare would kick in first, and they he would probably be eligible for medicaid (he doesn't have much money besides teh house).

I would rather not put it in my name, because I would face potential capital gains on the sale of it, whereas if i inherit it and sell it i'm paying nothing.

In the end, we don't want to lose the house.  I would rather pay the capital gains than lose it but i don't believe me wife is correct.

The prospective employer asked me what my title is, and I told him; if ""X"" worked there, and I said yes; and in what capacity - she's a per diem staff RN, I said. Then he asked if I had any specific comments about her, and I told him she's an excellent nurse and an exemplary employee. That's it. Nothing about salary, disciplinary actions, etc. My manager asked me what the deal was, and when I told her, she said in the future I should refer any similar callers to HR, because we're not allowed to give out any information about employment status, and it could be grounds for termination (not that she was threatening me - she was just letting me know). Is this really true as far as employment law is concerned? The information listed above is literally all I told the guy.

I'd like to write up a Work For Hire contract concerning the picture I'm using and the model in the picture.

"TX - Small town cops gave me a ticket for buying cigs for a minor. She's 23.. So I will keep this brief. Bought cigs for a friend since she is between paychecks. She told me I would have to buy them as her license was expired and the place we were at has legitimately given her shit for expired license before. She can not get her license renewed until she passes some court mandated course or whatever. I dont have all the details. 

Anyways long story short. I Buy them for her and a cop sees me hand them to her after buying them. He checks her ID, sees the date, and then tells her that it is expired and that he would need a valid ID. 

She says that is all she has and that I was driving. Cop looks at me and takes my license. He goes into his car and comes back out with a ticket for me to sign. Buying cigs for a minor... 

The date clearly says born in 94 on her license but because its expired he apparently can ignore this?

"Could the police keep an incriminating incident report with my name in it even though they have no evidence against me?. About 2 years ago I visited an escort at a hotel. Before I went in, I noticed there was a cop car parked at the edge of the parking lot. I thought they have no idea what I'm doing in there, so I just went ahead and went in. Afterwards, when I was driving away from the hotel, I noticed the cop car was behind me. He was driving behind me for a couple minutes or so, but then I turned and he went in a different direction. He did not stop me or anything. My guess is that the employees at the hotel reception desk were watching me on the cameras and called the cop as I was leaving. As I was walking out, I noticed a couple of them were standing looking at a screen and then one of them glanced at me and I am not sure if I am just being paranoid but I think I heard ""that's him"".

Is it likely the cop took my license plate number and put my name in an incident report saying they suspect I was visiting a prostitute even though they have no real evidence that's what I was doing? If so, can this information possibly be discovered by others in the future? And how long will it be kept?",0

"Factual of Innocence - How much should I be paying?. Dear Reddit,

I really need your help!

A little less than two years ago, I was arrested for Domestic Battery. No charge was filed against me. Worried that the arrest record could come back and haunt me one day, I'm now looking for a lawyer to help me with a factual of innocence motion.

Through my research, which has been mostly on lawyer's websites, I find that it can be a long process with little chance of winning. However, I do want to clean the mess.

I've been asking a few lawyers in LA and none has been very helpful. And their prices are ridiculously high for a student like me. I'm planning to drop out of college and would invest my last bit of money in it and want to make sure that I've invested in a right place. So I'd like to ask you guys a few questions.

How much do you think I should be paying for a lawyer to help me with the case?

How can I make sure that they are really doing their job?

And what are the real chances that I can have this motion granted?

"[DC] Intersection Car Collision. I was involved in an intersection collision last month. I was approaching a 4 way intersection. I had the right of way. The crossing streets have stop signs and under those signs are another sign which says ""Cross Traffic Does Not Stop"". The other driver did not stop at the sign and sped through resulting in me hitting the rear quarter panel of his car.

His insurance has denied liability stating that I should have seen him and because he was clearing the intersection he was at fault. I said I did not see him until we hit. They also stated I can not prove he was speeding.  I have a $1000 deductible with my insurance. Speaking with my insurance they say I do not have a strong case because there were no witnesses other than the people in the car and no police report. However, in DC Police do not write reports for these minor accidents.

Should I just go through my insurance? They will cover the damage but are not confident I will get my deductible back, not to mention the diminished value claim I can't file against my own insurance. Or should I just go to small claims court where I may have better luck proving he is at fault and get my diminished value claim.",0

"Missed DWI court date, because Out of Country.. Hello, this post is regarding my work colleague. He is a European and was in the country on a work assignment last year.  He was jailed overnight for a DWI incident in Dallas, Texas last year with BAC &gt;= 0.15. After being released on bail for $500, he was in touch with the bail company to check about the court dates, and they assured they were working on it. Unfortunately, he had to leave before a court date was worked upon as his work assignment got over. He was in touch with the bail bond fairly afterwards and they said nothing to worry about after his leave.

This year, he got called in again on a 3 week assignment. But, once he reached Dallas, he was detained at the DFW airport jail as he had an open warrant. After that, I bailed him out for $1500. After the bail, he talked with an attorney to sort out a court date, and the attorney said  they can represent him for $6000, of which he has paid $2000 today.

The girl roommate is still here, but tells me she can't afford the rent, even with my original asking price of $900 per month for 1 person.

Is there anything we can do for her? Truth be told, I've never talked to her before, and I only know things from what she has said, so I do not know the full story. But with the information that is available, what can be done?",0
"[MN] neighbor recently installed flood lights on their property, refuses to dim them or change their direction away from my windows. Is there anything I can do legally?. For some god forsaken reason my neighbor has decided to put up what I can only assume is industrial strength flood lights along their property line facing directly at my home.  They are probably 200ft away but extremely bright, well beyond the normal light produced by the average flood light. 

I have tried to ask politely if they could use bulbs  that aren't as bright, or change the direction slightly so they aren't shining directly into my home at night. They have refused and told me it's not their problem.

Could I legally build panels covered in reflective material in front of my property to reflect and reduce the light that is shining on my property? I have tried blackout curtains but they do not completely block the light.  I obviously don't want to do this if it isn't legal, but at this point I don't know what to do. 

I live in a rural area, so I'm not sure what specific laws would even be applied that I could look into, or if light pollution is even something that can be considered a nuisance. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1
"Can a car dealer give out my information to new owner of my old car?. Long story short, I traded in my old car for a preowned BMW a couple of months ago. The BMW was 5 hours away in PA, and because of my recent move/mother being on the registration to the old car, it was tough to get the paperwork lined up to pick up the car. 

She had to sign a SPOA to give me the right to trade the car in and get the new one. I guess the dealer didn't receive it back in time, so we wrote up two contracts, one with the trade and one without. The contract without trade was to be voided upon arrival of the SPOA and mailed to me. It was voided, but never went to me, until the family-friend lawyer got involved. Magically I had everything I needed. 

My latest problem is I understand my old car has sold, and the previous owner is now emailing and calling me about the car saying he's have all these problems with it. From what I understand the contract signed at the dealer prevented them from giving out my information. A quick search online also suggests this is against FTC regulation. I'm not looking for any sort of compensation for this, but my question is, can the dealer legally give out my contact information without my consent?",0
"Divorce From Another State [MA] to [NJ]. Home state: MA
New state: NJ

Hello. 
I am trying to divorce my husband. He is emotionally and financially abusive. I have proof that he had an affair with a 16 year old girl while we lived in Boston. I am going on vacation to my family's home in NJ. Would I be able to stay and begin the divorce process from there? I have a daughter so I am prepared for the reality that that may not be possible. I am just asking out of desperation because being here with him is driving me into a deep depression. 
 
Here are the facts:


* Married for 4 years
* He is a green card holder/non citizen
* I have picture proof of his adultery and abuse in text form
* Daughter, age 3, was born in NJ
* We lived in Boston for almost 2 years
* He doesn't want me to divorce him and has made marriage counseling appointments 
* I have 0 support system in Boston
* I have no job, he works under the table 



I know this is a shot in the dark question, as I feel like I definitely have to return to Boston to divorce because of custody reason. But I am asking anyway. I just wish to get out of here as soon as possible. I am numb right now but want to make the smartest decisions possible before I break down.",0
"AZ Was sent to collections for a month of unpaid rent. So back in 2007 I moved out of the apartment I shared with my boyfriend at the time. He had thrashed a bunch of my belongings during a rough breakup and I had filed a police report, but eventually dropped the charges the police were planning on filing (domestic violence). He continued to live there, and I moved on. I NEVER signed the lease, but had agreed to be listed as an occupant - I don't recall if that involved giving them my social security number but they must have had it because when my ex left the apartment he did so a month early and didn't pay that rent. When I got the call from collections (now living in CA) I was super confused and asked if his name was also on the debt. They said no, it was just me.  Yes, I've waited a LONG ASS time to do anything, mostly because I have moved states a couple of times and have not been financially in a position to pursue him legally. I've asked him a couple of times to do the ethical thing and pay me the $700 but he is cheap and mean and will not. 
At this point I get I may not have legal recourse, but just curious if this was even legal to do to a non-lease holder and would there be any way to remove the debt?",1
"(US) Landlord voided a new lease we signed and served me with 20 day move out notice.. My fiance and I decided to move in together as her lease had expired and she had moved to a month to month. We met with her landlady (who until recently had previously lived upstairs) and signed a new 9 month lease (07/05/17). She made some revisions in pen and told us she would scan it and e-mail us a copy. The next day we were having an issue with the new upstairs neighbor and had to talk to them about space and noise. We messaged the landlady to let her know what happened on (07/08/17) and she told us we could talk about it on 07/13/17. Instead she stopped by the house when I was not home and served my finance with a 20 day end of rental notice. (which in Washington is all they need to end a month to month.) I asked her what happened to our lease and she said because we were unhappy she voided it and no longer wants us to rent there. Neither myself or my finance agreed to voiding the lease but she says she did and that her lawyer destroyed it.

"First car accident, expired license+no insurance. What the hell did I get myself into, reddit?. I drove less than a mile to the store, I drove past a downed stop sign (it was literally on the ground because somebody else hit it) and was struck by another car. Nobody was hurt, we were going fairly slow. Damage to my car was worse, he had a scuffed/slightly dented fender. My window was shattered and the door was pushed in. 

I freaked out because I know I'm not supposed to be on the road and I saw the sign I drove passed. I said sorry, claimed responsibility and we took pictures.

He seemed nice and agreed not to involve the police, assuming that I'd get into trouble. Said he had no interest in taking advantage of me, however it was a company car and somebody has to pay. 

I'm confused, my parents are in the hospital because my mom got injured from something unrelated. I have no idea what to do. 

I don't have money, I am disabled and subsist off of SSI. What the hell do I do? My friend guessed it would cost around 1100-1500 for repairs. I have a trashbag on my window. 

Why don't I have insurance/license? Long story nobody cares. Why did I risk driving without them? Well, I'm a fucking idiot apparently.

"I came home from a week-long trip to find a notice to vacate by midnight tonight taped to my front door, how worried should I be? [TX]. The title says it all really. There's a bunch of scary looking language on the notice saying I have to vacate the premises by midnight tonight or they'll take action with the Justice of the Peace. 

Best as I can tell, this all happened because there was a mixup in the auto-payment system of the apartment and so no payment was posted this month. I was out of town on my rent's due date on the 5th and they posted this notice on the 7th. I didn't see an email or a voicemail or any other notice other than this one.

As soon as I found out about this, I went online and paid my balance. The office is closed today so there's no one I can talk to from management until tomorrow. 

Basically, I just want to know, what's going to happen at midnight? I obviously don't want to move out tonight, not that I have any way to do so. Also, what's going to happen tomorrow? I'd like to work something out with management and just pay my rent and all, but legally speaking, could they evict me anyway if they wanted to?

"Songwriting Ownership. Small-time punk rock band based in Monmouth NJ here.

So long story short, my band recorded an album a couple months ago with a drummer we'd been running for the past year. 9 out of the 11 songs on the album (yet to be released) were already written before we added him to the lineup, so he would technically have writing credits on those 2 remaining songs. 


The issue is that due to a myriad of reasons, we kicked him out a few weeks after recording. It was not very amicable, but he said at the end of the day it was okay to use his studio recordings on the album as long as he got proper credit. But now, on the precipice of this release, he wants his fair claim on the copyright to the album. 


Two of the members of our band, which includes me, feel it is not worth the hassle to fight for full ownership of the songs against him. The other two members want to keep him out of the copyright at all costs, but still credit him textually. 


I have no legal background and probably phrased some things incorrectly regarding copyrights, but my question is what are the ousted drummer's options for fighting us, and what are our options defending against his claim, if that's what we have to do? Thanks in advance.",0

My question is this; she is telling me that she is going to have the cops come tomorrow after I get off work to kick me out. I've told her that I need a notice to have some time to find a place but she's adamant in the fact that she doesn't need to give me a notice and she can ""do whatever the fuck she wants because it's HER apartment.""

"I work at a restaurant in Alabama, but don't get to keep any of the tips I earn. Is this legal?. I work as a server at a restaurant in Alabama. I am not sure if there are any special rules that apply to my state, but the general idea that I have come to is that the practice of the employer taking our tips is illegal. However, I am not certain if my specific case qualifies as being illegal.

Originally servers were paid $6.00 an hour in addition to tips(we had a tip share), however this was eventually changed to $7.25 an hour with the tips being collected and ""put back into the restaurant""(whatever that means). However, this is only for the lunch/dinner shift. The original rule($6.00 plus tips) still applies to the breakfast shift.

Is this legal for employers to do? I am given many of my tips in person by the customers I serve who thank me for my excellent service quite frequently, and I feel quite cheated to be forced to put this money that is by all rights *mine* potentially into the owners' hands.

"question about mail? fraud and my options. So, my MIL sent me an old apple watch, and since she's a bit absent minded she sent it via ups to my old address.  Its literally 4 blocks from my current address and UPS shows it was received there April 26.  I'd like the watch back, but understand that I don't have much ground since she sent it to the wrong address.  The package was addressed to me.  

I am hoping to go over and politely ask for my package, but knowing they will probably lie and deny that they have it, I want to make sure I have my options mapped out and am properly informed.

a few questions:  
Since it wasn't sent via USPS, this can't be considered mail fraud, correct?

Do I have any recourse?  I was thinking I could claim theft if they said they didn't have it and were using it (I imagine i could track via the serial number).  

I was thinking I could take them to small claims, but doubt I have much of a leg to stand on.  I'm not an eye for an eye person, but I'm pretty pissed about the whole thing.  I doubt the cops can do anything.

I'm more annoyed than anything.  I left them my address and phone number in the event anything showed up there, but I suppose the temptation of a used electronic was more alluring.",0

Does anyone have any experience with legal rights or protection of workers employed in at-will positions?  I know I can be fired without cause, but am I protected from relatiatory discharge or other forms of mistreatment while still at the job?

Additionally, do EO/discrimination complaints *only* apply to minority groups?  Is there another legal term for preferential biases that don't apply to age/sex/etc?

My next step is requesting a formal meeting and initiating the Dispute Resolution Program described in my employee handbook, but frankly I'm afraid to even go that far.

"US-PA Cited for my second underage, help. So last night my friend and I were riding home from a concert and were pulled over for speeding. Both my friend and I had sobered up to drive home, so we were not really worried about any DUI or alcohol charges. My friend stated immediately that this was a rental vehicle only he was authorized to drive, and that even if I had to drive I could not. The officer breathalyzed my friend and he was under the limit to continue driving home. The officer proceeds to breathalyze me and apparentely I still had alcohol in my system. Why I was even questioned is confusing to me considering I was only a passenger and had brought no suspicion. So my friend got a speeding ticket and I received an underage for literately sitting in a vehicle driving home. Worth noting this is my second underage charge, even though I participated in a program to have the charge reduced to a disorderly conduct. I also turn 21 in about 20 days so this is a huge and unexpected incovenience. I plan on speaking to an attorney tomorrow regarding this issue, but for now do I have enough to build a case and try to fight this charge?

The representative even had the gall to ask my sister if she wanted to make the payment on behalf of the former resident, (why on earth would we do that for a complete stranger...? Honestly...) which obviously has ticked me a bit.



No, I don't know who the resident is, there are absolutely 0 ties between me, my family, and whoever used to live here.

A friend of mine told me it's total BS and I could actually report them to the BBB for taking unnecessary sensitive information and rejecting us based on someone else's records. I've never heard of such a preposterous way to be rejected, and honestly I just want some decent internet for my home.

"Credit identity fraud by close family member. Hello there, so for some time now I have been aware that my older brother (28) has opened up credit card accounts in my name using my social security number. I'm not sure how he could have done that, but in the past he had forged my dad's signature and spent $20k on a credit card opened up in my dad's name. I am 24 years old and live with my parents and occasionally I check my credit report because of student loans. I made an account with credit karma before my brother started the fraud, so that is really the only proof of my own identity. Great Lakes Student Borrower services doesn't even use my name tied with my social security, it is my brother's name now. 

I tried confronting him about this two years ago and he has accused me of being on drugs and denied it all. I am pretty much 100 percent sure he is committing fraud against me, and the closer I get to finishing school and thinking about living on my own, the more I realize how screwed I am because of this identity fraud. I am a resident of the State of Wisconsin, my brother is now living in the State of Hawaii and I am suspect that he has also taken out a mortgage using my identity as well, any advice would be greatly appreciated.",0

"[Texas] Breaking lease for health reasons. I'm not entirely sure if this is a fixable problem, but any advice would be much appreciated!

I had a baby three weeks ago, and we found out that there is something in our apartment that makes it hard for him to breathe. We tried everything: cleaning, laundry, air purifiers, humidifiers, etc. think it's smoke from another apartment, but don't know how to prove it. My husband and I have been staying with the baby at my parents' house for a few days, and he hasn't had any trouble breathing. We took him back to the apartment for a few hours last night, and he started to have trouble breathing again. Whatever is bothering him, it was on all of the clothes we brought back with us until we washed them. 

Would it be possible to break our lease without penalty, if we can't live there? We need to find somewhere else to live, but that's not an option if we're stuck paying for this apartment. Our lease isn't up until December, and I can't seem to find anything definitive about options for breaking it. It looks like the management needs to make a good effort to lease out the apartment, if we say we don't want to stay, but I don't know how that will work out.

"CA freeway accident involving two motorcycles; he was lane splitting in HOV lane, I was changing lanes. I am at fault?. The accident happened in Irvine, CA. I was giving my girlfriend a ride to work on my motorcycle in the far left lane before HOV.

"Can POD accounts be officially/legally split according to a will?. My mother has a specific dilemma regarding her father's bank account she is the POD for.  The will states that all assets aside from a few specified things (house and property lots) are to be equally divided among siblings.  I'm aware that the POD is separate from the will, and that my mother should have a legitimate claim to all of the money.  However, her intent is still to split it equally as my grandfather wished.

The problem is that she currently has Medicaid healthcare benefits.  It's a given that she will become ineligible for Medicaid for a time, and have to prove that she as ""spent down"" the funds to reapply.  The question is whether or not the state (Ohio, in this case) will honor the fact that the deceased wished the money to be split, or count the entire sum as belonging to my mother even if she splits it.

If the state does not recognize the will in this case, and counts the money as all hers, she will be ineligible for Medicaid for a much longer time without being able to spend down any more than her own share.  Is she going to be forced to keep the money herself, so she can afford private healthcare for however long it takes her to spend the full amount?",0

So to start out I am a small time YouTuber looking to use viral videos in my channel in the context of ""Videos of the Week"". I contacted the publisher of this video 'Jukin Media' in hopes in receiving permission to use a specific viral video. However they told me it would be $1000 just to be able to publish in my video. So the most logical thing is I obviously cannot use it unless I am willing to pay them. However, I have seen this video all over the place, and I know for a fact that these channels did not get permission from Jukin.

I would be fine with not being able to monetize and all of that, I just want to use the video. However I do not want to get a copyright strike when I post it or in the future.

Everything is about to be finalized, but we were recently notified that my father is legally entitled to inquire about his potential share of the settlement.

My father is a deadbeat. He has had **zero** contact with my family for at least 15 years. Even with the advent of social media, he's never made any attempt to contact any of us via email, Facebook, etc. He never paid child support and owes tens of thousands of dollars. He's been to jail multiple times over this. When my sister passed, he never made any attempt to contact us and get details surrounding the circumstances. He didn't show any interest or concern over the situation. 

Emotional stuff aside, I can't imagine how he'd be entitled to any money. My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate, and literally every single part of this legal process has been under her discretion and supervision. My father's name is attached to absolutely **nothing** related to this lawsuit, my sister, and this family at this point.",0
"Gym is trying to send me to collections over unpaid membership fees, but I wasn't under contract and I haven't been going. I signed up for a gym in October 2015. It was a 1 year contract, that switched to month to month once the year was up. I paid throughout the whole year, and continued to pay until February of 2017. I had to suddenly move (long story) and in that same month got a new bank account, with new debit card. 

In the hurry of the move, I forgot to cancel the gym membership or give them new card information. I didn't worry about it, because I wasn't under contract. Any other monthly service not under contract would cancel automatically once they stopped being paid. 
This gym apparently is different. They made several attempts to call and inform me, but they were just random 1-800 numbers that I would never answer. 

Just now, I got an email from them saying that if I didn't pay my entire balance within 5 days, they would be sending me to collections.

What can I do? It's several hundred dollars, because they've added some bullshit ""late fees"", so it isn't an insignificant amount of money. And in principle it frustrates me. Why should I pay for the membership when I wasn't under contract and I haven't been to that gym in over 6 months?",0
"Question about a 10 year outstanding charge with bench warrant. 10 years ago I traveled to a far away state I didn't live in and was caught with a small amount of marijuana and paraphernalia. Of course the court date for the charge was months after I was caught, and by that time I had already returned to my home state. I was also very poor at the time and could afford neither a lawyer, court fees and fines, or the money it would have cost to travel back to the state. Over the years I had forgotten about it, but now I have remembered and I am wondering what will happen if I hire a lawyer to deal with the charges. Lets say I hire a lawyer and go to court to deal with the charge. When they convict me, how will that conviction look on my record? Will it show up as a conviction in 2017? How will this impact background checks for jobs? I know most checks only look to see convictions that have have occurred in the past 5/7/10/etc years. Will the fact that I waited this long to deal with it make it look like a crime that was recently committed, and hurt my chances to pass background checks? I have had background checks done since I was originally charged with possession, and had the warrant issued against me, but these never showed up on any of the checks.",0
"Caught with Adderal, What to do ?[Singapore]. Ok this story that starts around a few months ago, My family was lower middle class but I was going to good school that I had only gotten into because of Dumb luck during my PSLE exam. I wasn't able to cope and my grades began to slip first in english but then in math and eventually science. When My parents became aware of my slipping grades they pressured me to improve it by all meen nesscary.

They stopped letting me leave the house and spread lies about me to my friends to drive the away to allow me to concentrate on my studies. I was already using coffe to stay up in order study enough but it just wasn't enough, soon I resoreted to Adderal in an attempt to keep up. It was a godsend that allowed me to keep up with my peers and stop the pressure with my parents, my parents were aware of my usage but thye laid down some ground rules.

I would only be allowed to use the drug as long as my grade were either Distinctions or Merits in all my subjects. They also said that I had to provide half the money for the drug habit and that they wouldn't pay for a laywer if I was caught.

"eBay / Trademark Law Question. Background - 
Dumble guitar amplifiers are custom manufactured in very limited numbers by Alexander ""Howard"" Dumble. Dumble is a one-person operation; each amp is handcrafted by Dumble himself, and Dumble amplifiers are the most expensive boutique amplifiers on the used market. They regularly sell for six figure sums.

Hence there is a market for cheaper amps and guitar effects pedals that replicate the sound of Dumble amps.

I listed such a pedal, the Jetter GS124, on eBay. The pedal maker, Brad Jetter, is explicit in his description of the pedal, saying it was specifically designed to sound like a Dumble amp. (link - http://www.jettergear.com/pedals/overdrive-pedals/gs-124.aspx) I used this text and mentioned 'Dumble' several times in my eBay listing. 

Alexander Dumble complained to eBay and the ad was removed. 

When this happens eBay gives you the complainant's email address so you can try to resolve the situation. I emailed him and he replied saying I was not allowed to use the word Dumble as it is a registered trademark.

So my question is, could the word 'Dumble' be used in such an eBay listing? To be clear, the ad could not be reasonably perceived as selling a Dumble product, or a Dumble endorsed product etc.",0
"Breaking a non-compete agreement- Illinois. I am looking to leave (flee, rather) my current employer and one of the opportunities I am presented is the same position with a competitor that is opening a new location.  Back in 2011, contingency of continued employment was a non-compete agreement of 1 year and I am uncertain of the scope of the 'area of coverage'.  This is specialty retail, so I'm not sure what could be considered 'protected information or practices' I could be taking with me.
But clientele of this specialty visit most locations and I cannot imagine this not somehow getting back to my current boss if I were to leave and go to this competitor.  I doubt any action would be taken, but I do have a higher-than-most profile in this industry.

Kicker is, I am leaving because of a hostile work environment stemming from and sourced by the top of the food chain.  Berating, misplaced aggression, verbal abuse, swearing, I have documentation of instances that I could probably file a case and win with, but I'm not looking to sink a small business, just to keep myself from garnering a worsening mental state.

TLDR: If I am attacked over a non-compete, is a retort/defense of a hostile working environment forcing me to leave an acceptable legal defense?",0
"[Minnesota] Could my girlfriend, a filmmaker, be potentially opening herself for liability by filming inside of a store?. My girlfriend is a film student currently in college. She is working on a project for a friend, where she is producing a promotional short for a proposed product. This *is not* for a class, but rather for a startup competition done through our college. 

For part of the project, her friend would like footage of the inside of a retail store. He has a specific big-box store in mind, and has reached out to a manager of that specific location.

This whole thing leaves me a bit uneasy. I know that there are a lot of protections for work related to education, but I highly doubt that this project would fall within them. I also don't know whether the permission from a store manager would be sufficient to protect her if the store's corporate was unhappy. I'm also not convinced that her friend will properly convey that this is for commercial use.

So, I have two specific questions:

Is she opening herself to any liability by filming within the store and using it for a commercial promotion?

And second, is it possible to create a contract between her and her friend and/or the store which would eliminate her liability?

"[MD] ""Landlord"" turned out to be a crazy ex-con. I want to move, but I'm afraid he'll go nuts and try to keep my deposit, or something worse.. It's a long story, I'll do my best to keep it short. Back in March, I started renting a room in a house I found on CL (mistake #1). I came to find out from the other roommates that the ""landlord"", we'll call him D, wasn't actually the owner of the house, but the only person who's on the lease. The landlord is our next door neighbor. I also found out that D was in prison for insurance fraud, and has been in trouble for scamming and stealing in the past. I have no problems at all with any of the roommates (there are 5 of us right now), but the rest of them are all having problems with D right now, and a couple of them are threatening to move out. I was talking with one of the roomies roday, and she told me the tenant who had my room before me was evicted by D the same day he paid rent, and wouldn't return the money. This really worried me when I heard this. I know he has to give me a 30 day eviction notice, he can't just kick me out, but my main concern is getting my deposit back. What should I do? Should I lawyer up just in case? This guy is a psycho, I'm starting to get a little freaked out. Thanks for reading.",1
"Left job at the beginning of June, started new job in June, hours cut to nothing by beginning of July. Unemployment application question.. I filed for unemployment on July 4th. I had no hours at all from July 2nd to July 12th. That's basically two weeks of no work and I see no reason this will change. I am in effect unemployed.

I quit my previous job. My concern is that I will be denied unemployment because I quit that job, because when I look at the eligibility verification, it lists only the job I quit, not the job I have now where my hours have been cut to nothing.

I should say what is going on his not due to any misconduct on my part. I have been trying very hard at this job, but nothing I do makes the store manager happy. So she cut me down to no hours for one week, four hours the next, making me basically unemployed. I assume she isn't firing me because she is trying to get out of me possibly getting unemployment.

If anyone has any idea for what recourse I have, I'd appreciate it. I am looking for a new job but it's been slow going.

If I get denied I do plan to appeal, I'm just wondering what my odds are of not getting denied, since I'm filing unemployment for the job where my hours have been cut, not the job I quit.

"Fl-&gt;Ca Suspended License Catch-22. Back in Oct. 2010 I got a DUI in FL. My license was suspended until the completion of 6mos Interlock and a DUI class. I've spent the past few years using public transportation and have also moved out of FL. Where I've most recently moved in NorCal is very, very rural (I live on 40 acres, and all the plots are 40 acres) and I'm also in the process of getting a small Tech Support business started. So, I knew I'd need to get my license squared away.

FL tells me I need to get the Interlock device on a vehicle (which I have), then go to CA DMV with the paperwork, they will verify and issue a limited license (for work, school, errands, etc.), and once they issue my temporary license to mail a copy of it, along with some paperwork, to the FL DMV and they'll start the 6mos for my Interlock ONLY THEN.

I go to the CA DMV and they told me as long as FL has a hold on my license there's nothing they can do for me, Interlock or no. The DMV worker gives me the Mandatory Actions number, but they tell me the same thing.

It seems I'm stuck in a catch-22- the lasy with Mandatory Actions actually told me ""you may have to move to FL for 6 mos."" :|

"(Ohio) Woman and children effectively homeless after Ex-Husband files protection order against new BF. I have a friend who recently divorced and moved into a new house with her children and new boyfriend. She is listed as a tenant on the lease.

A couple of weeks ago, the new BF gave the youngest child a smack on the butt and apparently the children told the vindictive and sadistic Ex-BF/Father of the children and he wasn't very please. Eventually, a couple weeks went by and the Ex decided to file for a protection order, on behalf of the children, based mostly on lies and fabrication (they feared for their lives) against the mom's new BF.

Well, the protection order was served and instead of the new BF finding a place to crash, he essentially said that her and the kids needed to find a new place to stay until the court hearing.

Is there any legal recourse or way around this? She's listed as a tenant on the house, but I believe the BF is the lease holder. The Ex is trying to make the mom's life miserable and really gives no cares about the welfare of the children, as is evident by the fact that they are likely going to have to sleep in the car until the court date as the protection order is keeping them out of the same house as the new BF and he won't leave.",1
"[Orange County, CA] How to break out of a lease?. I am dealing with a two year lease, and the landlords are not being reasonable and not fixing any problems. They want us to fix everything.

They left the place a complete mess when we moved in and lie about everything. They expect us to take care of and repair things that were not fixed from the beginning.

It wouldn't be such a big deal, but their entire attitude is the problem.

For example, we told them that there is a minor roach infestation, which I had to purchase baits and gels, and they said ""Ok, thanks for the update"". They do not have any plans on helping to get rid of it.

The air conditioner which is in the unit does not work, although according to the lease terms we were supposed to notify them within 48 hours, but we never had to turn it on.

Anyway, I fear that I will be upset for the next two years dealing with them, what would be the best way to break out of the lease as they do not take care of the place, leave it a mess, and lie about everything.

They wrote on the lease terms that they are supposed to have a bidet in it (I never asked for it), but they refused to take it out even though it was filthy. - NSFW

"Help in verifying copyrights.... Hi r/legaladvice,


This is my first post in your sub, but I've done my homework by searching the sub and reading the various wikis. I still have some questions for you folks.


I'm gathering preliminary sources and images for a book idea that I have. This book would consist mainly of images, illustrations, and hand-drawings that _mostly_ come by way of the Library of Congress or government agencies. The Library of Congress states that the government works hosted on their site *""are also available for worldwide use and reuse under CC0 1.0 Universal.""* However, they also state *""you should determine for yourself whether or not an item is protected by copyright or in the public domain, and then satisfy any copyright or use restrictions when publishing or distributing materials from our collections.""*


My concern is that second snippet. 

- How can I verify that a work is truly in the public domain (or equivalent license)? 


- If I do publish an image that I find out is not in the public domain after publication, what options do I (and the copyright holder) have? 


- What sites or services can you recommend that will ensure I only use works that are in the public domain?


Thanks for any and all information.

"Received a summons for court in Ohio over unpaid credit card debt, please help!. I received a certified letter yesterday concerning credit card debt from 2 years ago.  A suit has been filed against me and I'm required to respond within 28 days.  I guess the big question then is, what now?  How do I handle this going forward?

Through some googling and digging, I've figured out that the debt is from a credit card 2 years ago, which was sold to this Cavalry SPV, LLC, which was then sold (or they're just representing) to the law firm that the claim is coming from.  Creating and logging into an account on the Cavalry website simply directs me to call said lawyer, so, I start researching said law firm.

Well, their website looks more like a collection agency than a law firm, with an option make payments, and warnings about ""any communications from this site is an attempt to collect, blah blah.""  Even though BBB is usually a scam too, the reviews and complaints make this place sound like an even worse scam.  So what should I do?

So to start out I am a small time YouTuber looking to use viral videos in my channel in the context of ""Videos of the Week"". I contacted the publisher of this video 'Jukin Media' in hopes in receiving permission to use a specific viral video. However they told me it would be $1000 just to be able to publish in my video. So the most logical thing is I obviously cannot use it unless I am willing to pay them. However, I have seen this video all over the place, and I know for a fact that these channels did not get permission from Jukin. Also, YouTube has contentid which puts your video through a system that allows publishers to put claims on your work for using certain works in your videos. It also does not allow you to monetize. I would be fine with not being able to monetize and all of that, I just want to use the video. However I do not want to get a copyright strike when I post it or in the future. Am I legally allowed to post this video and just let the ContentId catch it, which would allow Jukin to monetize on my behalf, or am I violating copyright rules? Thank you",0

Air conditioner - This is a tricky one, I had it looked at and the HVAC is completely dirty, apparently hasn't been cleaned in 10 years, the filters are messy. The guy says he has to take it apart to clean it up. However, I'm not sure if air conditioner counts as habitability.

They then told me it would be immediately removed from the system, BUT in order for there to not be an issue getting a new license, I can call their courthouse with the DMV office I'm going to tomorrow, and they will contact the office directly and let them know of the status.

Basically, I can get my license again and be legal now that I paid my fines, and I only had to Uber to work one day. :) Yay.

When we moved in our rate was 680€ warm per month, now mathematically that would be 780 per month, much more than advertised, even though it was said that 680 was already with heating and such. The people who live a floor below us live there the whole year, and I cannot imagine that they would pay 1500€+ as additional payment just for heating. Is this a common thing or are we getting screwed for our money? For context, this is our first appartment, we are three students who moved there for studying in a university and we've been living there since October 2015.",1
"Do I have a strong discrimination case?. I was an employee for a major silicon valley company. This was a remote position. I was recently terminated from my job just one week after making a request to have Sundays off to observe the Sabbath (I am a member of the LDS church).

The reasons for my firing were very shady. There was no final warning. Unemployment reviewed my case and decided that the company was in the wrong. I was hence awarded benefits. 

I decided to appeal my termination with the company. An HR rep finally called me back today to discuss the matter. I told the rep that while working for the company- shortly before getting fired- I was asked by my team manager which faith/denomination I belonged to and where specifically I went to church. The HR rep informed me that this was perfectly legal for my team manager to ask of me. I knew this was false. 

I honestly believe now that I was fired because of my faith. 

The good news is that I had the HR rep email me this same response in writing. They wrote that its standard for managers to ask 'clarifying questions' when making schedule changes such as I had requested. 

Everything I've seen online flies in the face of what this HR rep is telling me. 

Do I have a strong case for discrimination? Would I win a suit?",0
"Can you get a protective order. Recently my sister's friend confronted her ex, and father of her child, and he made claims about wanting to kill my sister, strangling his other children, and made a bunch of other threatening comments. Her friend recorded this conversation on her phone and took it to the police but were advised to simply get restraining orders as his comments were structured as ultimatums instead of immediate threats. After looking into the cost we started a GoFundMe to afford two restraining orders and some security systems, along with other items for self-defense, and then started looking into meeting a district attorney. 

Someone noticed the GFM campaign and suggested they both get protective orders, a form of restraining order as far as I can tell, as they're free of charge and essentially a do it yourself process. Based on what I've read only my sister's friend can get the protective order due to her relationship with them being on familial/formerly romantic terms, but someone told me he was able to get one simply because he was being frequently harassed by a customer at work and was even recommended to get one by a judge. Can my sister, who has no actual ties to him, get a protective order or will she have to go for an alternative restraining order?",0
"[MO/KS] assaulted by roommate, unsure of options. Roommate flew into a rage this evening about a lamp I broke and wound up punching me three times in the face. I did not return any strikes, he proceeded to call the cops. 

I did not stick around for the police to arrive for the reason below, which is why I need advice.

I've been effectively homeless for the last 2 months, crashing on couches and paying people a pittance with no lease etc. I've spread the love across a number of couches so no one friend gets too sick of me. Being homeless is the result of me having been kicked out of previous living quarters during an event for which I am now on unsupervised probation.

The only condition of my probation is to notify them of address changes... Well they've been so frequent and entirely unofficial that I am technically in violation of my probation. Thus why I didn't stick around for the cops.

Having reached a safe location for the evening I was able to examine myself further and I probably have a broken nose, but have no insurance or funds for medical attention (and refuse to use the ER for shit like this, I'm not dying). I would absolutely like to file charges however I suspect I'm fucked on being able to do so because of the afforementioned probation issue.

"Damage to our driveway by borough owned roads poor drainage (borough ~= county) (Alaska).. We have battled the poor drainage on the road above our home since we purchased in 2012.  The hill we live on is steep, but the road is sloped too flat, so instead of diverting water to the ditch (above the road), it is diverted towards our house (below the road).  During a larger than average rain event while we were away from the house all the water from above our house (large area with many homes) was basically diverted to my driveway rather than the ditches and culverts system that is in place.  A torrent of water ripped my very manicured gravel driveway to shreds with gully's almost a foot deep.  Rock from my driveway was transported up about 100 feet from the driveway on our yard below.  We gave the borough the chance to offer to fix our driveway and they didn't make an offer.  I think it may be time to get a lawyer.  What kind of lawyer do I need, will they require upfront payment, how do I pick a good lawyer?  They have previous plans to re-surface the road this year and we want an engineer to certify their plan will solve our drainage issues permanently, and to reimburse us for costs related to fixing our driveway (I estimate somewhere in the $4000-8000 range + legal costs).",1
"Traffic Citation issued with Court Date only 10 days away. First I'd like to say how much I hate Atlanta police department and their court. 

July 7th got a ticket coming straight off the highway onto a 35mph zone in Atlanta Georgia. It's a speed trap, they had so many ppl pulled over using a lidar gun. It's not fair that we get no time to slow down coming off a ramp, but whatever. I get the ticket and it's only 10days away from court date. Is that even legal? They say even on their website it can take up to 2 weeks (10 business days) to process. That would be passed my court date. 

I called the municipal court. This lady insisted I was reading the wrong date. I'm not. Even the cop was like 'call if 10days is too soon'. Uh yeah. So I check every day to see if it's processed. I asked the lady what do I do and she just responds with 'uuh, I guess you're just gonna have to wait til it's processed' 

I have a feeling it still won't be processed by the court date. I wanted to sign up for the Pre-Trial Intervention to maybe get the ticket dismissed or lowered, but even that you have to sign up before court. I cant even request to postpone court date without it being processed! I can't even pay it if I wanted to avoid court.

"Need some advice on a US District Court Violation Notice for possession of marijuana at a US National Park. Hello, I am a 23 year old male with no past criminal or any legal history. I was camping with friends in Acadia National Park in the state of Maine and we bone-headedly didn't realize that the land inside the park is federal and not part of Maine. We were caught with a small amount of weed and given US District Court Violation Notice that charges me with 36 CFR 2.35 (b) (2), ""possession of a controlled substance marijuana."" The park ranger repeatedly told me it was an ""infraction"" that would not appear on public record if I simply pay the fine to the Central Violations Bureau as documented in the notice. Is this true? Ive been reading online and have gotten conflicting information. Will this show up on my criminal record? What impact could it have on my professional-life or future? I am also planning on getting a 1 hour legal consultation. What would be the best ways of finding a good lawyer to talk to about this? Also I plan on calling the Central Violations Bureau tomorrow. Are there any specific questions that would be good to ask them? Sorry for all the questions I'm just really nervous about this.

"Can my employer get in trouble over this payroll mistake?. This is in Michigan. I don't know if that's relevant.

On Friday, July 14th we were supposed to be paid but there was a mistake and only about 5 people got paid out of all the employees throughout five locations in the franchise. 
The district manager says the only way he'll pay us is if we prob we didn't get paid. The only way I know how to do this is by printing up my account summary and bringing it in but I really don't feel like it's their business. Then after we do that, we get a paper check and have to sign a form and write down how much our check was for everyone to see. We have no way of verifying whether the check is even the right amount.

 I understand not wanting to pay us twice but the way he's treating people who just pretty much worked for free for the past two weeks is a bit rude...pretty much telling us 'you have to share all this personal information in order to get paid because of a mistake we made'.

This isn't the first shady thing this employer has done and I've been waiting for something like this to get them in trouble. I know how to file a wage claim, as I've had to before​. But are they technically withholding my wages?

"How would I go about purchasing a piece of my neighbor's property?. Hello all!
I live in a house in CT that has a somewhat unusual arrangement regarding the driveway. When we purchased the house, we were given an almost 30 year old agreement between two former owners, who agreed to ""grant each other mutual access"" to their yards for the sum of $1. The property line between the two houses runs lengthwise down the driveway. The yards can only be reached through the driveway or through the houses themselves. The lawyer who helped closed on our house told us that technically, as per the arrangement, both us and our neighbors could block each other from parking a car in the driveway, and that the arrangement concerns access to the yard, not use of the space in the driveway itself. So, I own half, my neighbors own half, and we split the driveway down the middle. 

They are considering selling the house and I'm thinking of approaching them about extending my property line to the edge of their house. Of course I would grant the new owners the same arrangement, whereby we can both access our yards from the driveway. Is there anything I'd want to keep in mind here? Legally, this was a strange-sounding arrangement to me, and I'm not sure what my options are or what the process is. 

Thanks!",1
"[IN] Girlfriend and I are probably going to break up soon, she's threatening to take the dog we adopted together with no say.. We have adopted a dog together last year and he's been a powerful emotional support companion to me. This is my first dog and she already had two others when we got into this relationship. We've already had several arguments and she's threatened to break up twice, and it's only a matter of time now I feel. The last argument when she threatened to break up she told me she's going to make this messy and take the dog and that there's nothing I can do about it. 

My name is on the adoption papers (and only mine) and he's been microchipped under my name as well. She's threatened to have the owner of the adoption agency (who's a friend of hers) change the papers to put them in her name, but I've got the conversation recorded. I haven't listened to the recording yet but it's saved on my iPhone and it was recording through my pants pocket, so I'm not sure about the sound quality.

Even if that doesn't hold up, the fact that he's microchipped in my name should be enough right? He's never been to the vet or anything. He's still young and has all his shots. I love him and I really don't want to lose my guy. She already has two dogs and he helps me with my depression.",0
"Camping supplies confiscated in Yellowstone, now they expect me to pay shipping. While in Yellowstone, I was pulled over for going 10 over. During a routine search the officer found marijuana, paraphernalia, and an excessive amount of money my friend was carrying.

During this time my campsite reservation expired and my tent was searched and subsequently seized. Among the items seized there was a camp grill, some bedding, a folding camp chair, and some clothes.

 The city police have followed through and charged me with theft.

He said that even though I'm innocent, ""throwing money at something sometimes makes it go away""..He says that all the prosecutor needs to prove at my preliminary hearing is that I was in Warren at the time of the incident. That my presence in my hometown is damning enough for a judge to assume they have enough evidence to go to trial.

Maybe I feel that way bc I'm scared out of my mind... He said if I bring the $150, that I would be facing a summary offense, and a small fine instead of facing jail time or probation.

"[Canada]Going to Court or Fighting with the Insurance. We are located in Alberta, Canada. 

Over the course of the past year, my mother has suffered a debilitating illness that has kept her from working.  There have been complications throughout that have significantly impeded recovery. With the prolonged recovery, the insurance company has become increasingly difficult (stopping payments, demanding more paperwork after requested paperwork was supplied, etc). 

My mom really does want to go back to work, but she, her doctor, and her employer do not feel that she can fulfill her duties at this time. The job is very hands on and requires snap decisions. Her employer supplied a list of duties that are required and her doctor stated that she could not fulfill them.  

We are at the point where a decision needs to be made. If we go through with the lawyers, they will ask for everything up to 65 (retirement age, which she is not too far from). However, that likely means the end of her employment. If we keep fighting with the insurance, we don’t know how long recovery will take and they are constantly looking for ways to stop coverage. 

Dealing with insurance and disability is not something we are familiar with, so any thoughts or warnings on which way to go would be helpful.  Thank you.",0
"HOA Special Assessment - Do I have any rights?. Hi there,
I recently found out that I'm going to owe over $3,000 to upgrade the elevators in my condo building - Chicago suburbs, IL. Our HOA fees are already ridiculous (close to $600 a month) and I was under the impression that part of the reason our fees were so high was that we were contributing towards funds that would take care of upgrades such as these.

The condos range anywhere from 80k-175k, so most residents are senior citizens on very fixed incomes, or young people getting their start in life. An unexpected $3,000 fee is REALLY stressing me out.

So I'm wondering. Do we have ANY rights at all? For example, should we have had the right to vote on this special assessment? Did they need to notify us? Shouldn't we have some sort of right to see what contractor they plan on hiring and vote on whether or not the amount is fair? I know when you submit yourself to an HOA building you are handing over rights, but I just can't imagine we wouldn't have SOME sort of legal protection - i.e. what if they just decided that they wanted to build a new swimming pool or upgrade the garage without our consent?

Any advice would be appreciated. I am so stressed out and it hurts me inside to see senior citizens on VERY fixed incomes worry as well.",1
"Hit and Run accident /PD (MI). Hello! So my girlfriend has received a traffic citation on Friday from an apparently hit and run accident on June 18th. It's a misdemeanor failure to stop property damage citation with no insurance/registration(She has proof of both)

She is claiming not to remember any accident, or damage to her car. I believe there may be a scratch on her mirror that's about 2cm but she says it's been there before.

Reckless/careless driving or other things at a later date from this incident isn't a concern right?

"Downstairs neighbours threatening to get us evicted for something we didn't do [London, UK]. Hi,

I live on a second floor flat in London. A few months ago we had a party and some cigarette butts were dropped over our balcony into our downstairs neighbour's garden. They were absolutely furious, we apologised, and let them know it wouldn't happen again.

This morning I received this text from our landlord:

""Hi, I've had another email complaining about more cigarettes being thrown into the neighbours garden and this time they are about to call a solicitor and possibly confiscate the flat from me. I've spoken to the lady at the council and she says the only way to avoid the solicitor getting involved is to issue you a final warning saying if it happens again I have to evict you. I am going to put this in an email (and cc her in), I just thought I'd let you know in advance. I would strongly suggest not letting anyone smoke on the balcony at all in future as they are obviously taking the matter extremely seriously. 
Thanks.""

We do not smoke and none of us have even been on the balcony in the last week. This must have been from people in one of the flats above, but they are clearly convinced it's us.

"$5700 stolen out of my safe. Hey, so the gist of the story is as follows. I have a safe in my house that is key operated that used to contain $11000 as well as a rolex and some other valuables, during a party I had a few weeks ago some friends slept at my house, one of them in my room because it has two beds.

Today, I opened my safe to discover $5700 was missing.

To clear a few things up..

* The safe is in my room

* I never take my money out of the safe and the safe stays in my room so there is no way I would have misplaced the money, I know when I have opened the safe, and the last time I opened it everything was there.

* The only people that knew about the location of my safe was a few of my closest friends 

* I have searched my house to see if my money was anywhere just in case

* the key to the safe was on my keychain which was next to me while I slept in my room

*  No one broke into my house or has otherwise had any unsupervised access to my room, the only time when the theft could have happened was while I slept after the party

* Me and my friends are all 17

* The money is all mine and of course I want it back

What steps would you suggest to recover the money, there is only 3 or 4 people it could have been, I have proof in the form of pictures and receipts that I had the money.",0
"(Saskatchewan, Canada) Medical Negligence/malpractice - diagnosed with blood clot in my leg 3 years ago, turned into life threatening Pulmonary Embolisms. I was diagnosed with a blood clot in my leg in 2013. Medi clinic Doctor didn't prescribe blood thinners or send me for an ultrasound to confirm it or even suggest a follow up afterwards. Ended up almost dieing in the hospital with pulmonary embolisms in both lungs so bad I passed out from lack of oxygen and my stressed out heart couldn't pump enough blood. After my diagnosis (two xrays and CT scan later) I was on clot busters so strong I had to stay in ICU for 24 hours in case my brain started bleeding out. During my stay, the info pamphlet they gave me pretty much stated flat out that PE is caused by deep vein thrombosis (blood clots) in the legs.

Currently on blood thinners right now for the next 6 months and am otherwise healthy. I think the Dr that diagnosed me completely dropped the ball with not prescribing treatment or requesting an ultrasound to gain even basic knowledge about what was going on and to that effect it's probable the clot remained for years and moved to my lungs (been having breathing issues for the last couple of years)...

"[New York] Startup extended stock option exercise period, then cancelled them. Hi /r/legaladvice, throwaway here.

I worked for a startup for two years and I was let go after I had vested half my stock options. On my separation agreement, they extended my exercise period from 90 days to 2 years, which made me not buy the shares and wait for an exit or something like that. Hindsight is 20/20 and buying would grant me a lot more rights.

Around 10 months after the separation agreement, my options were cancelled, and the CEO said this was because the extension wasn't allowed under the stock option agreement. A few lawyers went through the agreements and said this was BS. Despite this, she (the CEO) tried to make a monetary agreement for a fraction of what the shares are worth for me to give them up.

I'm under the suspicion this move is by her personally, and the company's directors aren't fully aware of the story. I thought about writing an email to the directors with a roundup, attatching the separation agreement, in which the extension is clearly stated, but I'm afraid this will give them more time to lawyer up and I'm naive to think this will change anything.

Should I try emailing the directors explaining my story, or go straight to a lawyer and send a letter of demand?

We arranged a payment play with David's Bridal owing ~$850 payments were supposed to come out of our account @ $50 /mo until October of this year and we would be done with the debt. This month we received a letter stating that our account was transferred to a collection agency and that we now owe $967 and they are demanding full payment. When we made the original payment arrangement we were trying to call to pay the balance in full but were talked into this arrangement which sounded good to us at the time because I had just been let go from a job we were just trying to get rid of the high monthly payment, but it sounded like a good plan to have the lower payment option and still only own the lesser amount.

We initially met with the lawyer at the end of June. The consultation seemed to go well but I have serious concerns about his retainer. 

The email he sent me took a week. Is this typical? Within the email there are serious grammar and spelling issues and the retainer has my name spelt wrong. It's also 3500$ CAD not including he actual processing fees. This is only payable by cash or money order. Is this normal?

The reason why we wanted to get a lawyer is because I was denied entry to the border in 2015 for insufficient evidence to return to the states. I was going to stay for two months, didn't say my exact day of return, was in my car with my fiancé, and had my dog with me. I have been to Canada at least 4 times since then with no issues.

I also was previously married and sponsored someone to become and American permanent resident. They have been a permanent resident since 2015.  We divorced in 2015. The lawyer said this shouldn't be an issue at all. Is this true? 

Thank you for the help. I live in Colorado if you need that info as well.",0
"[MD] Notified landlord if freezer issues; technician scheduled for nearly 3 weeks later. Freezer is unusable and all food has rotted. What are they liable for?. I first submitted the issue nearly 3 weeks ago. They scheduled someone for repairs within 5 days. I called off work to be home, and no one showed for the first appointment. I called the repair company, and it turns out they told my landlord they don't service my area.

My landlord have me a different company to call and schedule repairs with; they did not call back for another week. When the repair company did contact us, they gave us an hour's notice to call into work and wait for the for 6 hours or the option to wait another week. We couldn't leave work on such short notice, so scheduled it for their next earliest appointment (a week later).

I contacted the landlord and asked for an alternative vendor we could get out earlier. I offered to do the work of contacting and scheduling the appointment if they would provide a list of authorized vendors, and they did not respond. In the meantime, our food has rotted completely, we cannot use the freezer, and our electrical bill has gone up.

Is the landlord liable for anything? It seems like their attempts to repair the deficiency were/are severely delayed by their preference for one repair company.",1
"Catfished into someones house?. So I met a girl through kik messenger. Turned out she lived like a couple streets over from me. We talked for a couple days about what she's into, and she said she was really into like fantasy forced stuff. Through talking to her she agreed she wanted me to come over and have sex. So she told me when to come over, said she would be in her room and to come in the back door, which was clearly unlocked and opened just like she told me (have kik messages to prove). I go in and go in her room and sit down on the bed, it was dark so I had grabbed her leg accidentally not being able to see, and she starts freaking out and runs into the living room. I walk in there and ask her what is wrong with her, she proceeds to punch me in the head, and I just left out of the front door and walked home. I'm assuming she called the cops, in which case what can I do? I didn't harm her or touch her wrongly, and I have the messages to prove she told me to come over and everything. What should I do? Also, I started to think that what if it wasn't her that was messaging me. I am pretty sure it was, but I have the messages and pictures of her telling me exactly what she wanted with consent to everything. How should I go about this? I haven't been contacted by police in any way. Should I go to them?",0
"University never disclosed that they denied my loans, I'm now hit with a $31,000 bill that they're demanding I pay. For the 2016-2017 school year I was a freshman at a top university in New York. Second semester I withdrew because I realized I could no longer afford it, and moved back home to California. Because I withdrew in time, they refunded me half of my tuition for the semester, which was about $12-$13k. Almost as soon as I got the money, I sent it to my loan company as a payment (this was in March).

A few days ago I received a letter in the mail stating that I owe the school $31,000 (~$30,000 for tuition and ~$950 in interest) for the semester. I brushed it off for a few days until today, thinking that it was just a bill for next semester that was accidentally sent to me. So I called and the lady speaking to me told me that the bill was actually for the past semester, and that they had canceled the loan they had received from the government (I was never informed of this). She tells me I owe the $30,000, plus it accrues a 1% interest rate monthly, which is why I also owe around $950.

I can't afford $31,000 out of nowhere, hence why I even took the loans out in the first place.

My question is, was it even legal that they didn't disclose that they declined the loan money? Where do I go from here?",0
"Copyrights: questions about public domain works and how to verify a work's copyright protections. Hi r/legaladvice,


This is my first post in your sub, but I've done my homework by searching the sub and reading the various wikis. I still have some questions for you folks.


I'm gathering preliminary sources and images for a book idea that I have. This book would consist mainly of images, illustrations, and hand-drawings that _mostly_ come by way of the Library of Congress or government agencies. The Library of Congress states that the government works hosted on their site *""are also available for worldwide use and reuse under CC0 1.0 Universal.""* However, they also state *""you should determine for yourself whether or not an item is protected by copyright or in the public domain, and then satisfy any copyright or use restrictions when publishing or distributing materials from our collections.""*


My concern is that second snippet. 

- How can I verify that a work is truly in the public domain (or equivalent license)? 


- If I do publish an image that I find out is not in the public domain after publication, what options do I (and the copyright holder) have? 


- What sites or services can you recommend that will ensure I only use works that are in the public domain?


Thanks for any and all information.",0
"[CA tenant] moving out early, flood found new tenants now trying to ad random extra fees. landlord is trying to add tons of cleaning fees upon moveout, none of which are on the lease, how do we deal with it? 

Signed a lease in January with a crazy landlord that's non stopped harassed us since we moved in, refusing to obey by the 24 hour notice or just showing up uninvited so we asked to end the lease early. She found new tenants, signed a lease with them today to start September 1st and is now telling us we have to pay all of these additional cleaning fees that aren't in our lease. 

Telling us we have to pay her cleaners around $600 to come clean the place, hire a professional window cleaner, someone to do the carpets, and then someone to clean the backyard, when in our lease all it says upon move out we pay for a carpet cleaner, we have a dog so we agreed to this. She made us keep her gardener with the place, $50, a month, and she's saying the new tenants don't want to pay him but she wants them to have a gardener so she says we have to keep paying his fee until January and then she'll cover it after that. 

We haven't signed anything but she's trying to rope us into a document saying we'll be paying her around $1200 of our $2000 security deposit, not sure what to do about this. What grounds do we have?",1
"Virginia... I have gotten a protection order for my son and I which states no ”contact of anykind” and the police say my son staying in the same home as the respondent isn't a violation.. I filed a preliminary protection order against a man for me and my son. I spoke with the judge explained what happened and she granted the protection order and marked the box with the most strict form of protection available which  states the respondent is to ""have no contact of anykind” with me or my son. In our city there are no other types of protection orders and there is no space for a note more specific instructions like a distance the respondent is supposed to be within.

My son's mother has taken our son to stay at the home of the respondent. After calling the police twice the police have shown up to the house and told me even though they are in the same house together the respondent has not violated the order. The first day they said they promised to stay on opposite parts of the house. The second day the same supervisor in charge contacted me and said he checked on my son and determined he was ""safe"" and that I was not to call anymore.

"Newspaper says they have some incriminating information about me, should I just post it? [NY]. So, for the past year my family has been involved in this brouhaha about some crimes that they say my dad had committed, it's related to some banking trouble he had back in the 90s and I guess he had to get some bank money from places outside the USA.

Anyway, last year some guys we knew from those places where we got the bank money told us they had some cool stuff that we'd find useful. I don't want to get too much into what it was, so let's just say pogs.

So I met with these guys to get the pogs and when we got there, THERE WEREN'T EVEN ANY POGS, they just wanted to sell us a... well let's say a timeshare. I was kind of embarrassed so for the next year or so when people asked if we'd gotten any pogs from these guys or met these guys I said no.

The newspaper found out that there were some emails that proved I had actually met with the guys, but THERE WERE NO POGS. REPEAT, NO POGS.

Is it really a big deal to lie about a meeting when they didn't have any pogs to give us anyway? 

If it's important, I told the lie on some kind of national security clearance form.

I'm thinking, screw the newspaper, let's just post the email chain and prove to everyone that I never got any pogs anyway.

"[PA] Advice for SIL in abusive relationship with 2 kids please help. I'm hoping this will be coherent but my head is still kind of spinning so we'll see. 

My brother(M21) and his fiancé(F26) have twin boys (6 months). They are not married, they rent an apartment together. He is sole earner, she stays home with the kids. He is an alcoholic, he's textbook abusive (gas lighting, emotional abuse and two weeks ago he pushed her around enough to leave bruises) and it has come to light he's been cheating for who knows how long. 

My SIL (for lack of a better term) is at a loss of what to do. She's at her mother's with the kids, but apparently there is nothing legally stopping my brother from forcefully taking the kids and going to NJ. SIL is concerned for the kids safety, my brother consistently drives drunk. She has photo evidence of the bruises he left, the cheating, the horrible things he says to her. But she doesn't have the money to retain a lawyer. And he has grandparents who are well off and have paid his way out of trouble for 21 years. He keeps threatening her that if she leaves, she'll never see the boys again and that his grandparents will pay for the best lawyer to destroy her. 

Please help me find resources for her. What options does she have? Will she lose her kids to someone so toxic and harmful?",0
"[MO]Parents' divorce decree says my father is supposed to pay for my wedding. Is that enforceable?. I'll try to keep this brief.

My parents' divorce paperwork from 1989 in MO says that my father is supposed to pay for my wedding, if I have one. My mother says it is in there because she is very poor (she works for a non-profit), and my father's very wealthy, (He retired at 40).

While my father and I aren't super close, we're not estranged either. I live in CA so we see each other once a year, unless there's a major family event. I didn't know about this being in my parents' divorce agreement, so I'd saved up the money to pay for my dream wedding myself, but when I called my mother to tell her about my engagement, she immediately brought it up, even sent me pictures of that section of their divorce paperwork.

I'm not sure whether or not to ask him to honor that part of the divorce agreeement, but my mother is practically SALIVATING about it. (Their divorce wasn't exactly amicable.)

So while I'm weighing other options, I figured I'd ask so I have a clearer view of the situation. Is something like this enforceable? And if it is, what are the steps for pursuing it if he refuses when asked? If I don't ask him to pay for my wedding, and just pay for it myself, does my mother have the option of going after my dad?",0
"Need help regarding a critically ill grandmother.. Hello all, I'm based in the UK, my grandmother recently underwent a lung transplant, things have gone south as she had a heart attack and is now in a critical condition. My mother is looking after my cousin (as she lived with my Nan) and my Aunt who has downs syndrome. I'm posting on behalf of my mother on if the power of attorney (or what is it and we aren't completely sure) would apply. This is because my mum's step-father has been taking money off my aunty (with down syndrome) for himself whilst they've been staying with us, and we believe he may/ or may not, have taken my grandmothers stash of money she hid away in the house alongside her will. What I'm trying to ask is if there is anyway we can hold/take ownership over my Nan's and aunties bank accounts (as they're both in my nans name) 1. whilst my Nan is in her critical condition 2. If she doesn't make it through. Mainly to stop him getting ahold of any of their money (my mum is the executor on the will if that means anything) as he's began to say that he is looking for my nan's pin to pay for stuff whilst shes away (they had separate accounts for a reason and he isn't in the will whatsoever).

"[Boston, MA] Being evicted, notice initially served by text, can do I get more time?. My apartment building is being sold, and the tenants are being evicted. It's going to be combined with the building next to it and turned into luxury condos. I don't have a lease.

My (now) wife was served a ""termination of tenancy"" notice via an image in a text message on June 26, by a lawyer for the seller's agent, and told to look for the actual notice in the mail. We looked and it wasn't there. We contacted the agent to let him know, and he came by with the eviction notice the next week on July 3, which my wife signed for.

The eviction notice was dated for June 26, and states we have to be out by August 1, but we didn't get the physical notice until July 3. My understanding is that the owners are required to give a full rental period for notice.

1) Does an photograph of the eviction notice sent by text count as giving notice?

2) My wife signed (and dated July 3) the late notice. Does that mean we accepted the terms to be out by August 1? Is the notice even valid?

3) If we want to get a little more time before we are evicted, how do we do that?

4) Boston has laws about condo conversions. Since the two buildings are going to be gutted and combined before they're turned into condos, do those laws apply to me?

"Can't pay Colorado medical bill; US citizen living in EU. I'm a US citizen who lives as an expat in the Czech Republic and have a huge medical bill in Colorado that I cannot afford to pay, and now debt collectors keep sending my brother notices (I have my US mail sent to him).

Some background: I was visiting family after spending a year in Vietnam and got very sick two days before flying to Europe. I thought it might be a parasite (I previously had one in Vietnam) and was informed by a nurse hotline that only an ER can check for parasites on this short of notice. 

So I went to the ER and they gave me an IV drip, did blood work and stool sample, and gave me some meds. They would not give me any sort of figure for how much all of this would cost, not even ballpark. They just said ""it varies"". They were pushing to do a stomach ultrasound and I refused because it sounded expensive. They were very unsympathetic to the fact that I had no US health insurance and that I'd be paying out of pocket.

Now I have a bill for over $5000 that I can't pay. I don't even have any assets worth that much money.

I don't live in the US anymore, although I visit about every two years. What's my best option here? What sort of legal action are they able to take? Do debt collectors do payment plans? Are they able to go after my brother?",0
"[Georgia]Signed with Jukin Media and want out.. I recently signed a contract with Jukin Media granting them the rights to license my video to other media outlets. I was offered $200 up front for signing and 70% of all revenue made from the video.  
  
I didn't research the company as much as I should, and now I'm wanting out. I have not filled out any personal info that would allow them to pay me, so as far as the contract states, they can't use the video. The contract said this about terminations:  
  
&gt;T4. Termination. Licensor may seek to terminate this Agreement at any time; however, this Agreement shall only be terminable upon the mutual agreement of the parties, the consent of which may be granted or denied in Jukin’s sole discretion. No termination shall impact any prior license of the Images by Jukin prior to termination, which shall continue in full effect under the terms of this Agreement.  
  
Since I cannot be paid and they cannot use the video because of that, I don't see why they would want to deny the termination request, since the video would seemingly be in limbo.

Today my husband got a call from the lady who sold him the property saying that she wants to break contract and move our home elsewhere into another one of her available properties all because the man who lives right next to our property is complaining that our home is too ugly to be next to his or in his immediate vicinity. The lady is siding with him because this man turns out to be the city commissioner. 

The other available properties are not the same as the one we have now. They are by a creek and they pretty much get flooded every time it rains. The lady did offer to pay for someone to move our home again and use the first downpayment for whichever other property we get so we wouldn't have to pay twice but we don't want to settle for less just because this man feels superior to us but we don't know what to do.

"UT, ex using marijuana around children. I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit or if there's a better one to post under. Background is, I live in UT, divorced, 50/50 custody. 3 children, 2 teens and an 8 year old. My child just came to me with pictures of text conversations and pictures of the edible gummy marijuana that her Dad is using. Marijuana is illegal in UT and its really upset my kids. I am so far out of my element here. I don't know a soul who does drugs, let alone what to do since their Dad is now using them.


I have several concerns. First off, apparently the kids even know who is selling him them. My feelings on marijuana aside (I do beleive it should be legalized), I don't want someone who is obtaining a currently illegal drug and selling them around my kids. Second issue, aparently the 5 times he's admitted to being stoned the kids were with him. Add to the fact he just lost his job, and these seem like red flags to me. 


Do I call the police for this? He seems in a downward spiral and no, a conversation won't work. He has no family here and the latest job he lost was working for a friend so I imagine he's low on a support network right now. Would the police even care about drug use with marijuana? He won't see a therapist of any kind, doesn't believe in them. But he needs some type of wake up call.",0
"[New Jersey] Is my grandparents bank doing something wrong? If so, how do we properly complain about it to regulators?. Hi r/legaladvice,

I was helping my grandparents organize their finances and 1 item that stuck out was that my grandmother has a credit card exclusively in her name with a balance of about $5K. She has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and a lot of this balance is due to recurring payments/bills that never got cancelled along with the interest that goes to that. At the time she was diagnosed the balance was around $2K or so. We plan on paying this off in some way as this is a valid debt in the grand scheme of things.

I want to point out again that this credit car was only in my grandmother's name - not my grandfather's - until a month ago. A few months prior my grandfather pointed out to the bank that she has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and that the card was in her name exclusively. Shortly after this communication they put the debt on his credit report (it wasn't on there prior).

Is this legal for them to do that? If not, what should we do? I want to complain to the regulators (i.e. OCC, CFPB, and the State Attorney General)- if I say that I will complain about them to regulators if they don't fix this is it blackmail? I haven't had an issue like this before and want to do things the right way here.

"Received doctor bill for no show, never had an appointment.. Hello everyone I'm in a bit of a bind. I called a doctor's office to set up an appointment in January. I made an appointment and they told me I needed a referral. I told them to cancel the appointment and call me when they received the referral. This was all in the same phone conversation.

Here it is 6 months later and after sending two referrals, they never called. I received this bill last week for $50 for a no show appointment. I cancelled that appointment and even if it was still an active appointment there was no reminder call/text/email which I opted for.

So, I call the office and get an answering service. She directs my call to the office manager who does not answer. Her answering machine clearly stated that of the call was for a no show bill to submit in writing. So these people send out these bills so often that she needed to put that on her message. I left her a message stating who I was, why I was calling, and asked for the address to send this letter to. No call back. I've called several more times and still nothing.

I've really had it with this office. I looked at their review on Google and it seems I'm not the only one with this issue. They have horrible reviews and some very similar to my experience.

"I recently purchased a dental practice where the old owner routinely violated labor laws. Am I at risk if he is sued?. To be more clear, I am a dentist who purchased a dental practice. Technically I bought the equipment and goodwill of the selling doctor. I hired all of the old employees to a completely separate LLC from the old doc. So I did not buy his corporation. 

Anyhow, for the last couple decades he has had his employees come in around 6:30 and clock in at 7:00 when they see there first patient. Then at the end of the day clock out at 5:00 even though they would have to keep working until 5:30 or so to clean up and type out notes and such. 

Another employee would routinely work 44+ hours per week and never once received overtime pay. She was not salaried and was not exempt from overtime pay by any law that I could find. 

Finally, one other employee was given a ""salary"" even though she isn't eligible to be a salaried employee by the IRS guidelines that I have read.

The problem is, the vet tech was fired, so it's not like contacting her boss is an option. What are my friend's options here as far as getting her to stop go? Does not seem legal at all to share patient information like this.",0
"Payback Period at Work. Throwaway acc. 

I currently work for a company making a low wage for the area that I'm living in. A (shockingly high) 40% of my income is put towards my rent. The other 60% is split between food, utilities, gas, student loan payments and the remainder going towards personal interests and very little going towards savings.

Anyways, I was given a ""promotion"" 7 months ago (only in responsibility, not in title or salary) and part of the position required that I receive professional training that totaled $1900. I was asked by a manager that I take the class (over the phone, then the classes sent to me via email). My company has a 1 and 2 year payback plan. Over $2500 is a 2 year payback and under is a 1 year payback. So if I leave within the next 5 months, I'm being told I'm required to pay back the full $1900.

Can they legally require me to pay back the training cost when it was asked that I take the course so I was able to fulfill the duties of the ""promotion"" I was given? Unfortunately, this would be a prohibiting factor of me leaving this company unless I were to receive a signing bonus elsewhere. I do not have even half of the money to pay back. 

I live in VA and the company was incorporated in PA and all of our legal documents say they are governed under the law of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.",0
"Can my girlfriend sue for defamation? (NH). My girlfriend works for a summer camp and just yesterday she was talking with a camper about clothes. She (girlfriend) likes to make her own clothes by hand sometimes. The camper I guess said something about how she had holes in her shirt that she wanted to fix or something like that. Girlfriend commented that she (camper) could have made the shirt herself much cheaper.

Now this camper's batshit insane mother is claiming that my girlfriend ""abused"" her daughter and is threatening to talk to a higher-up about pressing charges if they don't fire my girlfriend. Unfortunately not only is New Hampshire an employment-at-will state, she also signed a contract acknowledging that she could be let go at any time.

She talked with and apologized to the mother (though she did nothing wrong), and apparently things were looking to be going in her favor, but apparently today another camp employee complimented the camper's shirt or something and mom started in again saying that the staff weren't taking her seriously, so now things might not be going in her favor anymore. It's hard to tell of course.

If (god forbid) she does get fired and can prove it's because of this, does she have a case to sue for defamation?

Please let me know if you need anymore details although there really aren't much more.",0
"What Should I Consider Before Releasing a Bot Service to Select On-Campus Housing. Every day at 4:00pm my college campus posts available on-campus housing contracts for sale at an online webpage. There is a huge shortage of contracts for students (and nearby off-campus housing is expensive) so the demand is huge and getting one of these contracts is like winning the lottery. I attend a private university.

I wrote a internet bot that refreshes the housing page 30+ times per second and reserves a contract the instant it appears. I successfully used it on myself to get a housing contract. I feel like if I released my bot as a service there would be a big demand for it. Something like ""Pay $50 to guarantee a contract"".

What things should I consider from a legal perspective before launching this type of service? I would need to collect their login information, log in on behalf of the student, and use my bot to put the contract on hold. I wouldn't need to actually pay for or sign any sort of lease agreement for the student. They would finalize the contract after later logging into their account.

In other words, could this be illegal? How should I know if this could get me in trouble with my college? Is it a bad idea to talk to the college directly? Are there other business models that could minimize my risk to legal repercussions?",0
"[IN] Burglar caused damage to apartment - Landlord says I am responsible for damages. A burglar broke into my apartment while my friend was there and attacked my friend.  Fortunately nobody suffered any major injuries. The police were called immediately after the burglar left and I have already requested a copy of the police report.

Besides for the theft of some of my personal property, the struggle resulted in damage to the apartment unit itself.  For  example, to the window and screen that was pushed in, the blinds, the wall, etc.

The landlord is telling me that I am responsible for the damages to the apartment even though it was the result of the criminal act of a third party, not me or a guest.  The lease states ""The cost of any repair to the premises or unit as a result of damage to the premises or unit during the term of this lease (other than normal wear and tear) shall be Your responsibility.""

Is my landlord correct that I am responsible for these damages?  While the lease appears to have no carve out for damages caused by a third party, I'm wondering if Indiana law addresses this in some way.

FYI, I do have renters insurance that also covers Personal Liability for property damage.  I'm calling them shortly to see if they will cover the damage to the apartment itself.  I know my personal property is covered.

Another woman in the kindy office said to show up alone and plead my case, but she has no authority and could tell I was frustrated.

"Landlord Withholding Security Deposit past contracted return date. Who do I sue?. I was a landlord-approved subtenant in Baltimore, MD for a period of about 3.5 months. I paid a $700 security deposit to the property manager, who signed the lease addendum with me and the other tenants as an agent of the landlord's company. The lease addendum clearly states that the security deposit will be returned within 45 days of the end of my sublease.


It has been more than 45 days since the end of the lease, and still no security deposit. I have a copy of the lease that states it must be returned in 45 days, a picture of the $700 security deposit check, and bank statements that show the check was cashed. I also have an email from the property manager who confirms that  I am not liable for any damages. It seems like a pretty straightforward case, and I believe that I have the proof to demonstrate that the security deposit is being withheld unfairly.


My question is, who do I put as the defendant if it goes to small claims court? The landlord that owns the property? The landlord's rental company? The property manager who signed the lease and accepted the check? Not sure if it matters, but the the landlord lives in California, and his company and the property manager are both based in Baltimore I believe.


Any help would be much appreciated.",1
"[FL] Can my apartment lease be renewed then transferred without my agreement and the security deposit be held from me?. So I rented at this somewhat shady apartment complex and I decided I will not renewed this year. The lease was a joint lease between me, Roommate A and Roommate B. Roommate A and I decided that we will no longer rent here and we're moving out meanwhile Roommate B decided that he will stay there and bring in new roommates. I decided that I did not want to renew this lease nor be involved with this apartment unit any more so I will not renew the lease and they can decide what to do on their own.

Fast forward a month, I heard nothing and the lease is almost over so I checked with my roommate. They said that they already renewed without me or my other roommate and then 2 new people signed the lease instead of us. The security deposit will not be given back to me but the 2 new tenants will be responsible for paying us back. I understand that the security deposit is probably binded to the the unit therefore if someone is staying in the unit, it remains. But they also told me that 'legally' the new tenants are required to pay us back. Is this true? What if the new tenants do not pay Roommate A and I our deposit back? Was it legal in the first place to have this apartment unit renewed without 2 of the leaseholders? Thanks!",1
"Los Angeles Municipal Code 80.56E4 Question. I live in an area of Los Angeles where parking is extremely tight and limited. My complex has 100+ units and 10 private parking spots. It looks like some people have taken to spray painting red zones to create additional parking spots that look like other zones which are painted white. In addition, I was operating under the belief that your front tire has to be within the boundaries of a parking spot when a red zone is involved.

I received a ticket for an LAMC 80.56E4 violation, which reads:

&gt; 4.   No person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle at any time in any red ""No Stopping"" zone or portion of street posted with signs reading ""No Stopping Any Time"", except that a bus may stop in such zone or portion of street marked or sign posted as a bus stop.

She is not allowed to leave the house for anything but work or school. She's had a history of self-harm, eating disorder, and various mental illness. Her parents have actively berated her for these issues, saying 'you're a disgrace to this family' 'you ruined our lives' etc. She's gotten in trouble for sneaking out and smoking cigarettes, sure, not right, but the punishment was a closed hand beating every time. She was caught trying to sneak out last night, and in a weird trance, told her mother everything she's done. She admitted to not believing in God, having multiple boyfriends (which is not allowed), and still smoking. 


Now, her father, who is a pilot, is away for now, and she wants to get out before he comes home. There's been multiple instances of the mother having to stand between her and the father to stop further harm being done to her. Her life is genuinely in danger, as not believing in God is about the worst thing she could've said.

"[US, FL] My sister's weed got found, will she go to juvy?. Throwaway, first time posting here. I'm really paranoid right now because my sister (13) first of all, got caught shoplifting a couple months ago along with my other sibling. They have to do community service and stuff, and go to these appointments with their case worker. At their last appointment my sis made a suicidal joke and admitted to self harming. She was admitted to the hospital, the psychiatric ward I think, again. She had already been to a psychiatric ward about a year ago after she admitted to having suicidal thoughts at a doctor's check up. My mom grabbed some clothes from home to bring her, and in the pocket of one of my sister's jackets there was weed. She hasn't smoked for a couple months now as far as I know, but I guess she still had it laying around. The staff said they will ask my sister about it tomorrow. 


I'm just really worried that since this will be her second offence, and idk how much weed there was, she might go to juvy or something. I have no idea what usually happens in this case, is there a possibility she (my mom I guess) will just be fined and my sis gets slapped with more community service? We really can't afford a fine anyway but it'd be better than juvy. I hope just having at least an idea of what might happen will ease my mind. Thanks in advance.",0
"[Comcast, CA USA] Comcast capped my data usage despite my explicit declining of their ""service upgrade"", so I'm now paying for something different to what I agreed to- can I sue them for breach of contract?. They keep referring to it as ""policy change"", but they have, in reality, altered the essence of the service provided: I have signed a contract for unlimited data for a certain price, and now they're charging me the same price for a limited amount of data. 

They have issued a notice around New Year's saying that they intend to do so; I have immediately called their customer service and said that I do not accept that type of service to which they have told me that the """"new policy"" is not being rolled out yet"""" so basically to chill since is not impacting me any time soon. I have just logged into my account to discover that the data cap has been imposed for some time now without anyone contacting me after my declining of the altered service. 
Does this qualify as a breach of contract given that I have specifically declined any alteration to my contract? 

Again, they keep saying that it's a ""change in policy"" which, based on their standard contract terms they have the right to update, but I see it as a change in service provided since I'm now getting less for the money I'm paying and I specifically disagreed to take that cut. Thanks guys!",0
"Forming a corporation... do the titles of President, Vice-President, Secretary, etc. necessarily have extreme legal importance?.

We are equal partners at this time.  

He told me he was going to have his lawyer draw up the paperwork, and that he would be listed as President, and I would be Secretary.  Is it unusual to list the second person as Secretary?  I told him i thought it would be more appropriate for me to be listed as Vice President, and he said okay... but when i received a draft of the paperwork, i was still listed as Secretary in it.

So should i be concerned about this, or are the titles more or less arbitrary?  I assume that two people cant be President, so I am fine conceding that to him due to his experience, but should i insist on having the title of Vice President for legal reasons?

As a side note, i dont believe anything malicious was intended by not changing it in the paperwork, it's more likely that he just forgot to do it.  He had a multi-million dollar company with nearly 100 employees in the past, and is extremely knowledgeable about tax codes and legal partnerships, and such, so i pretty much trust his judgement... but i am still curious.",0
"Billed for Medical services can't pay have a plan to fix it. Hi all,

I'll try to keep this simple. My health plan(New York Medicaid) covers 20 visits of Physical therapy a year. I might or might not have gone over 20 visits when I started going to my current Physical Therapy Office. I went to PT for 3 visits and got billed $50 for each of the visits. Now in this point of my life, $150 is a boatload of money and can't afford to pay it off. Apparently my plan can't help me out as I went over the 20 plan limit and the PT office didn't confirm whether I was at my limit or not as well.

So I'm basically stuck with this bill and it will possibly be sent to collections.
Now I have a ""plan"" perhaps on getting this resolved which may be a bit un-kosher.
You see this same office billed my insurance company (NY Medicaid), for an EMG of the Neck and Lower Back and they were paid $3.5k for each part.

However when I asked the office for the report they tell me they only did and have a report for the EMG of the Neck not the lower back even though they billed my insurance for it and got paid $3.5k.

So I want to try to ask them to waive my physical therapy balance of $150, so that I look the other way and don't report them for billing fraud to my medicaid health plan. I'm not sure this will work but I am all out of options, and would like any and all advice.",0
"[NY] - Unemployment - employer forcing ""invention"" agreement.. Basically, I work as a software developer for a company in NY. Here for almost a year. Today, the company both rolled out a new employee handbook, referred to as the ""culture code"" and the ""employee innovation and proprietary information agreement""

This agreement appears to be a mashup of a non-disclosure and non-compete, but being a developer - I am really concerned with this. Apparently, even if fired/quit - any invention I made is to be considered theirs for 6 months after employment. 

Whatever - so to ""continue employment"" I must sign and agree to whatever stipulations are placed in both the handbook and the ""invention"" agreement. If I refuse, I assume to be terminated.

I'm okay with this. However, would I qualify for collect unemployment? Per [NYS Title 7 - 593 - Disqualifications](https://www.labor.ny.gov/ui/dande/titles/title7.shtm#593) - I don't see any specific case of which this could apply to.

Basically, I would not be terminated either (a) voluntarily or (b) for misconduct.

"(VT) Explain like I'm five: Private arbitration agreements in employment contracts. I recently applied for a position in a VT branch of a major insurance provider. During my application, I had to agreement to private arbitration for any legal disputes before, during, and after any potential employment. 

In addition to signing away any right to pursue a class action, disputes covered by the arbitration clause include things like sexual harassment, unpaid wages, discrimination against protected classes, overtime, and other issues clearly covered by both Vermont and federal labor law.

This is unlikely to ever be relevant for me, but I just want to understand, because this seems a little nuts to me. Basically, if this employer were to, say, refuse to pay me for wages I had earned, and I couldn't work it out through negotiation on my own, we would then go to a ""neutral"" third party selected by the employer. This neutral third party, while technically supposed to make a judgement based on actual law, could really do anything. They could just say, ""lol, you ain't gettin' paid"", and then I would get no money. I would not be able to appeal this decision... Is this correct?? I guess I don't understand the point of labor laws existing at all if employers can just have people, for practical purposes, sign away their rights. This can't be how it works, right?",0

"[BC] Safety concerns involving custody with grandparent guardian. After a sudden separation my child has gone to live with their father and their grandmother. I am unable to have custody right this moment for a few reasons.

Once those reasons are settled on my end I intend to file for primary custody. One of my many reasons I believe it's in her best interest to be with me lies with my ex-MILs blatant disregard of our parenting requests and such.

The specific incident I am curious about is an allergic reaction to diaper rashes. She used a brand of diaper my child severely reacted to and was told both in writing and verbally to stop and switch to the brand we use due to the reaction. She didn't and my child reacted badly again, and ever since has had extreme stress and anxiety to getting touched down there. Diaper changes are now really, really upsetting for my child and although I made progress with getting them comfortable again they've completely regressed since entering into her and my ex's care.

My ex-MIL has a history of this kind of thing (ignoring people and doing what she wants) and there are other more minor incidents involving my child.

She lives in the basement which is not particularly marketable for various reasons and its very unlikely that we could get a new tenant before the first so I objected on a number of moral grounds to be sure but primarily a financial decision: I can't afford for rent to go up that much.

"Questions about estate planning and trusts. Hi legaladvice crowd,

I met with an estate planning lawyer recently, and she drafted up a will, power of attorney, etc. that I am currently reviewing.

I am somewhat naive about how all this works, but could you kindly let me know what is ""typical"" or standard practice for Trusts?

-----------------------------------

* For the trust itself, once it is set up, how is money put into it?  Is money transferred from all of our accounts into a single account in the trust?  What about stocks that we own in brokerage accounts?  Our house? Is the executor/trustee required to sell these and have cash, or are they just transferred into an account owned by the trust?

* The Will indicates that all interest earned on the principal within the trust is to be distributed each year to the beneficiaries. Is this normal?  Why would it not just accrue?  Do I want a 10 year old receiving tens of thousands of dollars each year?

For background, my wife and I have one child (a 2 year old).  If we both pass away, the trust would be set up and money distributed in three installments when our daughter reaches certain ages. Estate right now is about $3 million once you take into account life insurance proceeds.

I do plan on asking follow-up questions to our attorney, but wanted to try to make them sound somewhat knowledgeable!

"{Iowa} Offered to babysit kitten, now owner won't take him back. A little over week ago, my bf and I offered to babysit a kitten for one of my bf's friends. We were told by her that the kitten was 9 weeks old and was litter trained. She also wrote that she would pay us around $20 a week to watch him. When she brought over the kitten, he was obviously to small to be 9 weeks and he hadn't had any of his shots. Later we found out he wasn't litter trained. Since he is so small he requires a lot of attention and we both think that he is more around 3-5 weeks old.  

We contacted her about making appointments for the kitten to receive his shots and to be dewormed, along with requesting she bring kitten food instead of the cat food she ended up bringing. Soon it was obvious that she probably just wanted to dump the kitten on someone, we asked her to come pick up the kitten. She then messaged back that he was our problem now and she was not responsible for him, and if he was that much of an issue we should put the kitten down. She then blocked us.

Are any legal options we could go about returning the kitten or even reporting the owner? Is she required to pay us the money she told us she would? We have all the text messages about the kitten.

"[Upstate NY] There seems to be some confusion in my office if our on call system is legal. Just want to clear things up.. I work in an IT office in Upstate NY. We have two forms of on call.

Level 1: On call for a week Friday Night - Thursday Night. 2 AM when our office closes to 7 AM (8 AM on weekends) when it opens. Work is done at home on a company issued phone and laptop. You get $7 a night to reimburse for internet bandwidth used. You get paid for the time you spend on a call that comes in. 5 minutes minimum to keep the math easy for hours worked (i.e. if you spend 3 minutes on a call it's logged as 5). The sum of hours worked gets added as overtime as you still work M-F 8 hour days.

Level 2: On for a calendar month. 11 PM - 7 AM weekdays, 5 pm - 8 AM weekends. Work done at home with a company laptop and phone. You do not get compensated every night, but if you answer a phone call once you get $5 reimbursement for internet. Same rules for logging time on calls applies as level 1.

Some people seem to think these procedures are outside the NYS labor laws and I can't seem to find anywhere where that would be true.

"Received a job offer for independent contract work. May not be what it seems.. So this guy has owned a trailer based business washing windows for awhile, every now and then on big jobs he has had college aged kids come help him complete those jobs. He files as an sole proprietor and pays the kids in cash. He is leaving for a couple years, and bought another trailer. While he is gone he wants me and another guy to run the trailers. He calls us independent contractors and asks for a 30/70 split of profits. We use his client base, and primarily he does scheduling. His name remains on the trailers, and we do not own the equipment but to dodge legalities I would be leasing the trailer from him.

He had no idea what a 1099 is, and has claimed all wages he paid to people that helped him as business expenses. What problems exist here? I can provide more non-identifying information if that helps. He also has called me a foreman in a video he put in social media.

The reason I ask this is that I believe this is an employee/employer relationship and could get troublesome fast, but there are some gray areas that could prove it possible to make work. 

I'm not really interested, but he's also a friend and I want him to know why I'm turning it down and that he needs to fix some things. I'd also like to understand the situation better, and I don't think he even knows there's problems. Thanks!",0
"Does plot structure/tone/character archetypes apply to ""fair use"" of an IP?. Most of the ""fair use"" discussions that I've seen on here focused on either musical parodies or graphic IP's but I'd like to see if ""fair use"" extends to things like a plot structure. Here's some context:

Right now, I'm hoping to make a comedic puppet series that bases it's plot on Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None."" In doing so, I will certainly rename the characters/locations but will most likely use the archetypes (doctor, judge, church lady, etc.) and the general plot structure (10 people go to an island where one is killed off each day). It would be a comedic riff on the book and not much outside of it thus disqualifying for satire (as I understand it) and I can't imagine it would have any positive or negative affect on the original copyrighted material. So is there any sort of legal precedent any of you know might know of that addresses comedic literature-to-film adaptations? 

For what it's worth, the book was published in 1939, Agatha Christie is no more, and I'd say most people are familiar with it. I doubt that makes a difference but I thought it might.

Oh, and I live in the United States and may post it on YouTube which I understand has its own set of rules n such.

TL;DR version: Is a re-named comedic adaptation of an old, well-known IP a bad idea or not? Thanks, friends-in-law!",0
"Issue with Tenants leasing on AirBnB in NOLA. I own a property in New Orleans that has 4 units near Bourbon Street. I had issues with two tenants who would rented two units. They would rent one unit out on AirBnB, and then stay in the other unit. This was not an issue until damage occurred and the City of NOLA started fines for unlicensed AirBnB rentals similar to Denver.

After removing the tenants, the city received an ""anonymous"" tip that my units were being rented on AirBnB. During the hearing, the lawyer that represented these previous tenants happened to be at court, and mentioned that he heard the owner (myself) planned on renting the units via AirBnB directly.

I ended up getting fined $3500. I never said this, nor did I ever intent to rent via AirBnB. I obviously plan on appealing, but I did manage to find a previous AirBnB listing for my property that was removed here: http://airbnb.com/rooms/12874458

I'm honestly wanting a little justice, and was curious what you all might recommend.

Their attorney obviously sticks out for malpractice, but if I can get this listing info from AirBnB, then I can show the previous tenants were renting the apartment and not me. I just emailed AirBnB to try and get this basic info like the listing, description, who rented it, and the reviews.

I'm not sure what else they would disclose without law enforcement etc.

Any advice what to do?",1

"[IN, US] Found dog in Dec. eventually adopted out to a friend. Previous owners have made contact via lost dog posters in July. Do they have any legal claim to the dog?. Here are all the details.  I found a dog in Dec 2016 in my neighborhood - no collar and no chip.  The dog was malnourished, full of fleas and other parasites upon further vet visits.  I posted that I found the dog on FB and used a site to send a poster to all foster homes, shelters, and vets in the area.  No responses and eventually the dog was adopted out to a friend of mine through a foster agency. 

7 months later, that friend is on a trip to Hawaii and I have the pup to watch.  During one of our walks I was approached by someone who claimed that it was his pup.  He said we could have him and he didn't have room for him and I figured that was that.  Today I have gotten a call from one of the vets where the poster was hung about the dog I found in Dec. (they left a voicemail and I havn't called back - I want more legal understanding before I do).

Do the previous owners have a legal claim to the dog?  Do I have legal obligation here?  I took care of the dog for about three days before handing him off to the foster agency he was eventually adopted out to.

I know it sucks to lose a dog and I have no intention of stealing the pup; he was adopted out legally and has been provided for by my friend for the past 7 months.",0
"[Ca] Father wants to lease apartment, doesn't make the required 2.5x rent amount. Can I sign the lease and not live there.. Expanded:

My father and step-mother need to find a new apartment. My dad is in the middle of fighting for state disability, and currently has no income, my step-mother's income is enough to pay the bills but they can't afford their current place anymore.

All the apartments they can afford have a rule where all occupants must have an income equal to/greater than 2-2.5x the monthly rent, collectively.

What is the legality of my signing the lease with them, listing my income, and claiming to be a tenant/occupant without actually living there?

Off the top of my head, I don't think it would be illegal, it would just appear as if I am renting multiple properties.

But I am asking you fine folks just to be sure.

Also, what are the potential ramifications if the rent does not get paid? I understand that they would be able to come after me for the money and I would be on the hook for any unpaid rent. But would it or could it affect my credit negatively?

Could an ""eviction"" on that lease impact my current renting status in my own apartment?

Basically I'm just trying to get an idea of what I would be getting myself into. I have not agreed to do this, it is something I am considering to help out my parents.

"Ontario, marked a charge for a service I did not sign up for as fraudulent on my credit card. Just received a threatening letter in the mail from a credit service.. So about half a year ago I noticed a $200 ish charge on my credit card that I had not made. Looked up the company in question and found many complaints about continued charges after cancelling the service this company provides (online dating). I then called my bank and got them to mark the charge as fraud and they sent me a new card. Yesterday I received a letter from a credit services company. The letter begins by saying this is a 72 hour demand. It goes on tell me it has been sent in accordance with provincial legislation and that the credit service has attempted to find a solution with me, though this is the first time I have heard anything from this company since a had to get a new credit card. Then it says the debt is past due and IMMEDIATE LEGAL ACTION may be the only way to resolve the matter. It tells me after obtaining a provincial court order they may garnish my wages, attach real estate or property I own, seize money in my accounts, seize and sell assets and have my finances examined in court. ""There is still time to deal with the matter"" it goes on to say but if no reply is received in 72 hours they will make a referral back to the client for IMMEDIATE LEGAL ACTION with no further notice to me.

"Unique Pet-Related Malpractice Question. Thanks to all the professionals who take the time to read this sub! 

My question is basically about how I might proceed to get legal counsel for the issue in the Philadelphia area - and I believe it's an unusual issue, but you let me know.

I have a dog who, for some medically unknown reason, has a history of bone fractures and orthopedic surgeries. Last year, he broke his front leg and received surgery at an orthopedic veterinary specialist clinic. This involved attaching a plate with screws to the broken bone. About two weeks after, the plate became detached, and he became lame. I brought him to the same clinic to diagnose the issue, and they incorrectly diagnosed it. Eventually, as it worsened, I went back, and they x-rayed him to discover the detached plate. He then went in for a second surgery. It has now been several months since, and I felt a need to get him x-rayed him again, and it turns out the fracture did not entirely heal. I do not know if this is due to a surgical mishap, but I consider it likely, as his previous x-rays showed no brittleness or other obvious reasons why his bones wouldn't heal properly. 

Again, this is in Philadelphia. I believe this is a malpractice issue, given the history with the clinic, but that'll be for a lawyer to help me decide. If you can offer some suggestions for how to proceed, I'd be greatly appreciative.",0
"Landlord is trying to kick us out by lying about finding traces of a dog being in our apartment. What do we do?. We need advice! We live in California and have lived in our apartment since March. This all started because I requested reasonable accommodations from the landlord for an emotional support animal. I have a legitimate need and my therapist wrote a letter to my landlord to explain. 

To be clear- we do NOT have a dog or any other animal yet. An animal has never been in our apartment or building in our time living here. 

But, the building manager wrote us today to say they found traces of urine in the hall and dog feces behind out back door (there are animal feces there. I don't know where they are from). They then said that we have had a pet in our apartment in violation of our lease and therefore will need to leave and end the lease early. 

What can we do? We haven't broken the lease, again no animal has entered the apartment, and I just sent the official letter from my therapist on Friday, so they should receive it in a few days. 

It's also worth noting that this landlord is pretty negligent. It took them over a week to get us a smoke detector and the landlord who owns the building (and we have never met) entered our apartment without cause or notice a few months ago. This is all admitted to in writing from our landlord too. 

Any and all advice would be very much appreciated!!",1
"Recently I brought up a concern with my employer about compensation for using my car for work and when I should be allowed to clock in.. For the record, I'm a mobile phlebotomist. I drive my car to the patients house and collect my specimen and drop off at the lab.

I had a meeting with her and the result was that she is going to pay me for the work I've done at home so that's good, but what I'm trying to find out is when I'm supposed to clock in. The office is 35 miles from home but I usually don't go there, and never before I see my patients, and instead may drive for over an hour before I get to my first patient which is when I'm supposed to clock in.

So then I do my job drawing blood then drop off the specimens at the nearest lab and after that I'm supposed to clock out. Many times I'll be an hour or more from home.

What is my boss supposed to be paying me for driving between 100 and 200 miles a day?

When am I supposed to clock in and out for work when my boss sends me an hour from home to work?

Finally, after our meeting they said that until my pay was sorted and a new contract is drawn up I won't be getting any phlebotomy jobs or other work (I understand this qualifies me for unemployment?)

If my boss comes back with a b.s. contact paying me less (she claimed that part of my 13/hr payment was for vehicle upkeep.) Or something else what happens if I don't sign it?

"[NYC] broker did not inform me of bad bedbug situation in building before I paid deposit. What to do?. I put down a deposit on an apartment. The broker told me the housing management company name/contact only after I put the deposit down. When I called them for lease signing, the management company told me over the phone that the building has had cases of bedbugs in 4 out of the 6 floors within the past year, including the floor below the unit I put a deposit on, but would not tell me whether the unit directly below mine had been infested. My unit was not infected within the past year. I talked to previous tenants and they said the bedbug issue is an ongoing problem.

Now I know NYC housing law requires landlords to give notice of bedbugs in writing before lease signing, but as I was required to put a deposit down with the broker, not the landlord, before even finding out who the landlords were, is there a way for me to get the deposit back? The broker did know about the bedbug situation in the building, he says he forgot to tell me.

The deposit states that if the application is not approved (it was) or the apartment is not given to me, then I am entitled to the money back. It also says that if the application is approved, I am not entitled to a refund. The deposit was about 1500, so I would really like it back.

I know this would be more appropriate under a financial subreddit, but I'm worried there will be some legal implications so I thought to ask here first.

Last night I went to check my credit score for the first time (19, only have a joint student loan w/ my dad and a credit card in my name, which I got 6 months ago) so I went to CreditKarma.  Perfectly fine score, but it appeared there were two loans under my name.  One was a joint student loan from Sallie Mae, which I knew about and receive emails from etc.  The other was a student loan taken out individually before my 18th birthday.  My dad has never used this bank (Cornerstone) and never took out a loan in the amount listed.  After some research, it appears that loans can't be given to minors individually in the US anyway, so I'm not even entirely sure how a bank allowed this to happen.  I also know I never received a check for thousands of dollars I apparently took out.  I know I need to call someone and let them know what's going on.  Who is it exactly that I call?  I assume not CreditKarma- maybe the bank?  Or do I need to find a lawyer and contact the police for some stolen identity case?

He quit his part time job and is solely relying on his SSDI to pay the bills. He has an untreated mental illness and refuses to seek any therapeutic treatment other than antidepressants. If the situation arises where he returns to drug use and cannot feed nor house his children - I am planning to sue for guardianship/custody and move them to VA where we both work.

I have kicked the can far enough down the road due to his lying and manipulation - but those kids deserve a better life. DCYF already visited his home and did nothing about it.

"Property managers fleecing low-income tenants on water bill? (San Diego, CA). Backstory: I ""sponsor"" a family of Syrian refugees who live in my area. Basically my husband and I have become friends with them and help them them out with adjusting to life in the U.S. 

Recently while translating their mail I noticed that their water bill is unusually high. They are six people in a 2-bedroom apartment but their bill is $100/month. That is more than I pay for a 3-bed, 3-bath house with a yard. I tried calling the company listed on the bill, PC Water Co, and it was just some woman's voicemail. She never returned my messages. I asked the property manager about the rate and they said they charge $25/person with a maximum payment of $100/month. The units aren't individually metered, to my knowledge; everyone pays this flat rate, and the property management company turns around and pays the utility. It seems that PC Water Co isn't a real company-- it's just the billing arm of the property management company.

I'm pretty sure this policy is stated in the lease, but it feels unethical. And if the property management company is profiting off its tenants, isn't that illegal? 

Several of the other people in my sponsor-family group have noticed this issue and we want to do something about it. It strikes me as a ""poor tax"" that is exploiting these people who don't even understand their bills. Do we have any options?",1
"TX - TSA and Police accidental law broken. Okay I am going to keep this as short and sweet as possible.  For Christmas I was given some ""Cat Eyes,"" which apparently, are technically brass knuckles.  I had no idea, they were a gift and threw them in my purse and never thought about them.

I was travelling for work and the TSA saw them on the x-ray.  I was pulled aside, the police were called, because brass knuckles are illegal in Texas (another thing I did not know).  I believe they ran a background check, which came up clean because I don't have a criminal history, because I am generally a good person.  The TSA took pictures of my ID with my boarding pass, phone number, and the ""Cat Eyes.""  The police let me go and that was that.  I'll be honest, I was in such shock I didn't really hear much of what they told me, except that they were going to destroy the ""Cat Eyes"" that I very much hope they do, because I don't want to be carrying around anything illegal.

However, I'm concerned that I'm going to get a phone call or a letter stating I will need to go back to the city this happened in, to face charges, because I was technically breaking the law.  Now I didn't know I was, I certainly wouldn't have kept the stupid thing had I known it was illegal.  Is it likely that the city police will still come after me after letting me go?

"(PA) Is it or is it not legal to dock pay as a punitive measure?. A conversation with one of the owners of my company has me wondering.  He is advocating for docking pay for mistakes.  His example was to dock an hour of pay even if the mistake took the employee only 5 minutes to correct.  His reasoning is that docking only 5 minutes of pay would not hurt the employee enough to not make the mistake again.  His intention is to punish not to recover actual costs.

This is also a job with a lot of judgement required and grey areas.  Therefore, this would be a matter of him deciding after the fact that performance or the outcome was not sufficient. 

The employees make over minimum wage and are part time hourly employees.  In researching this, I found conflicting information.  The law says that hourly employees must be paid for all hours worked.  It also says that pay can be docked as long as overall compensation does not drop below minimum wage.

Before anyone says it, yes, I am looking for a new job.

1. Can he deduct pay, by the hour, as a punishment?
2. Would it make it legal if he made it a set dollar amount, like a fine, as long as it does not drop below minimum wage?
3.  If he could reason that the company lost X dollars due to the mistake, would that give him legal rights to dock pay?

I don't understand how reducing agreed upon pay by arbitrary amounts could be legal but the law seems to contradict itself.",0

"[CA] Scammer Sent Me A Check. What Is My Responsibility?. I listed an item for sale on the app LetGo for $300. I received a full price offer and provided my PO Box for payment. Since then I've had several red flags.

 * The buyer asked for my phone number for the check, and since we've been communicating via text. The buyer has used two different phone numbers.
 * The buyer has yet to provide a delivery location. When I bring it up, I am told they will provide one once I receive the payment. 
 * The buyer revealed on Friday they sent a check via a tracked method and became very pushy that I cash the check over the weekend via an ATM or mobile deposit.
 * The buyer states they want the item by Wednesday as the reason for the urgency.
 * The cashier check that arrived was drafted from an Atlanta, GA local credit union, with a return address of Brooklyn, NY.
 * The cashier check that arrived was for $1,850. The sale amount was $300.

Obviously this is a scam and more than likely the ""buyer"" is going to ask me to arrange shipment and then graciously let me keep the overage. Not going to happen.

"fast food is upselling illegally?. I've been eating at a particular Carl's Jr restaurant. I am always greeted in the drive-thru with an immediate promotion, which I have to decline politely, before I get a chance to speak and order what I actually want. After my order is taken, the employee will always prompt me with an upsell, ""add a cookie for just a dollar?"" or something similar. However recently I noticed one employee was automatically increasing my combo to a medium, which costs more than the regular small size. At first I let it go. But today I decided to order inside at the counter. I recognized the employee as the same one that took my drive-thru order last time. As soon as I stated which combo I wanted, she automatically reached for the medium-sized soda cup and that's when I had enough. I pushed it back and told her that I didn't ask for medium, to please give me regular size.

I was very annoyed by this type of slimmy sales tactic--I wish I caught it on video (next time I visit, I will record with my mobile). Is this illegal? Can fast-food employees try to slip a fast one on me without first asking if I want the bigger size combo? I can only imagine how many people didn't notice and paid more without knowing, or guys like me who noticed it right away and now have to deal with this pushy sales trick all the time.

"Clearing a bench warrant (Arizona). I know similar questions have been asked before, but I know advice can vary by location as well.

I work from home so the driving hasn't been an issue lately, but now I am trying to get another job -- and even if I don't drive (because of my license), I want to clear the warrant before applying, or at least be well on my way to taking care of it so I can explain it to any potential background checker. 

I know the best thing is to get a lawyer, and that potentially a lawyer will offer a tiny bit of free advice -- but is the advice going to just essentially be that it's best to have a lawyer, and that I need to get it cleared ASAP? Because I know that, but I have no money (like, just enough to pay bills and probably set up a payment plan with the court if necessary). If I go to the court, or even just call, what happens next?

"How long can a company ""investigate"" a missing order before it is considered theft, if ever? [BC, Canada]. I ordered a product online about three weeks ago, with an estimated delivery date of 5 business days. That date came and went, but what was really weird is that the tracking information never updated past ""label created"". So I called the company and asked what was going on, and eventually had myself escalated. They tell me that an internal investigation, typically taking 2-3 business days, will be needed. Well, we're at 9 business days now, with no developments.

The specialist has been sending me an email every other day, but they've just been saying that there have been no updates or new developments. Since the product was never delivered, and I asked to cancel my order outright. They said that no cancellations or attempts at a second shipment can be made until this investigation is complete.

Now, I know that I'm not there yet, but I would like to know how long the company can continue to stall without delivering the product? I mean, there has to eventually be a line where it crosses into theft territory, as I have given them money for goods that have not been delivered.

"[UK] I haven't received an energy bill in a year. What should I do?. Throwaway account. 

I moved into a flat (in an apartment block) with a work colleague last September in the United Kingdom. From the start we had a number of problems because the place was newly converted from offices to flats. The water company had the wrong pipe down as ours and had to come out to check which one was ours and our internet through BT took 6 weeks to get working as they lines were crossed with another flat too. 

Since that date, we haven't received a single energy bill. We were initially told that we were with one company, who I contacted through their online messaging system saying that I had not received a bill. No reply. After 3 months I contacted our lettings agent and she told us that the new energy company were unable to locate our line, so didn't convert us. I think there is another mix up as to which line is assigned to each flat, as with the water and internet. 

The lettings agent told us that we were still with the original energy supplier, which had us under a plot number rather than a flat number. I haven't contacted them and haven't received a single bill since. I am due to move out of the flat at the end of August (after one year renting) and I am wondering what I should do. What happens if I don't chase? Will I get any penalties?

So I'm not sure if it is too early to be posting here since this just happened today but I want to get ahead of this thing. Anyway, I live in Ontario, Canada. My friend ordered a package for my girlfriend and it was supposed to be delivered to our house. My friend accidentally put the wrong address and it was delivered to the house across the street from us. When it was delivered and our landlords did not get the package, we realized that it had been sent to the wrong address and I went over to the house after work to pick it up. When I got there someone living at the house answered the door and said they didn't know of any package. She told me that there were 5 separate people renting rooms in the house and that she'd leave a note to ask the other tenants if they had gotten the package. It is pretty important to my girlfriend that she gets this package and she is out of town right now so I have to deal with this situation. My girlfriend is convinced that the package will not be returned and says I need to go back there or call the police or something similar. I just want to know what I should do if no one there returns the package to us. How long should I wait to do something if this happens?

"(NJ/NY) Filing for divorce, uncontested, no kids, and an agreed upon separation agreement. Thinking about moving states, should I file first?. My ex and I were living in North NJ for 4 years, and have been separated for 8 months with a separation agreement that we are both fine with. All our money is currently separate except that he's still on my health insurance.

My ex moved back to NYC, and I've been living here in NJ still, but want to move back to NYC as well. I just got a lead on an amazing deal for an apartment in NYC, but the catch is that I'd have to move in 6 weeks, when I was planning on moving in like 3-4 months after I filed the divorce papers in NJ. Should I go ahead and file in NJ in the next week or so? Is that enough time? I am fine with traveling back for court dates. Or should I wait and file it in NY after we meet the residency requirements (it would be February 2018)?

Are there any legal advantages to file in one state versus the other? Our divorce is super simple so I was planning on just doing the paperwork myself with a lawyer consultation/review. And as far as time from filing to divorce, is there anything that could prevent me from moving? If worse comes to worst, I could keep my mailing address in NJ if necessary. 

I'd rather not pay his health premiums for the next 6 months, so if I can file easily in NJ, I'd prefer to do that, unless there are advantages to waiting. Thanks for your advice!",0
"[CO] I'm a tenant, I violated the lease 7 mos ago by subletting the house. Landlord found out and now wants extra rent for those 7 months, void my lease and keep my $3000 deposit.. Hi /r/legaladvice,


I'm a tenant in Colorado. I am 1 year into a 2 year lease where I've always paid rent on time. I violated the lease in Jan (7 mos ago) by subletting the property (ie signed a contract with a roommate for him to move in and pay me rent). Landlord found out and now wants extra rent (1/2 the monthly payment) for those 7 months, he claims my lease is now voided and he can keep my $3000 deposit.


The tenant I was subletting to is now gone and I don't think the landlord has any concrete evidence that he was here. My understanding of CO tenant law is the landlord has to give the tenant 3 days to cure the lease violation. If they do, the lease still stands. I do not have an understanding of the laws governing the landlord's ability to collect more rent for that 7 months since I was renting out their property.


If possible, I can find a new place and move in by Aug 1st. 


My desired outcome from this situation would result in the following (in order of importance to me):

* not paying any extra rent for the past 7 months that my subtenant lived here

* eventually getting back my deposit - any damages to the house

* no damage to my credit

* no eviction on my record


I would really appreciate any advice on what I can do. Thanks.",1
"[Louisiana] Question about if multiple possession charges received at same time interact with each other once in court.. I was a arrested months ago and was charged with possession of marijuana, cocaine, and paraphernalia. My question has to do with how charges interact with eachother. 

Basically me and my friend got pulled over and the cop took me and him out the truck when he saw weed and a pipe. At this point we were under arrest for possession of weed and para, i had the coke in my pocket. The cop was asking to search my pockets but i told him no, he left for a lil bit then came back saying me and my friend are splitting the possession of weed and that gave him the right to search my pockets. Then he found the coke and everything happened.

I heard from some people that I could go into court and tell the judge it was not my weed and i was just riding in the truck and get it dropped as long as he said the same thing and did the probation for the charge. 

Would this mean that the coke is inadmissable because they found it saying it was my weed? Are charges independent from stuff like that once they become official? This is my first offense and am looking to do the pretrial aversion, so would just having the coke charge be easier to deal with than three? Im just wondering if this is worth doing or if I am going to be doing the same thing wether i manage to get the weed charge off or not.

All input is appreciated, Thanks",0
"Fake ID Charges. Hello, here is my situation. 

I was at a public beach on the 4th of July in Massachusetts. I was drinking with friends, and we noticed a few cops had appeared on the beach. Naturally, we shied away from said cops as we were already away from our stuff. One of our group members was not with us, and she was near all of the bags, especially mine. She was apparently questioned about the alcohol and such, and they dumped beers out of my bag. They did not stop at the beers, and searched through my entire bag, finding my wallet. They then searched my wallet and found my fake ID. I returned a few minutes later after the police had left, and was told all of this by the friend who had been questioned. Now, a week later, I receive a notice in the mail calling upon me to appear at a hearing in august to defend myself against these charges. The charges were being in possession of a fake ID, and some miscellanious charge that is specific to my municipality and that I figure I need to call in to ask for it to be identified. Was it legal for them to search my wallet? I was under the impression that police require consent or a warrant to search someone's property. I was not even present and therefore not complicit with their search. 

To add to all of this, I turned 21 on the 5th......... and although that does not take away from the legal implications of this charge, there is an added ""fuck you"" factor because of that fact.",0
"Erosion Problem in Backyard of &lt; 1 y/o Home. As title says, I have lived in my house for just under a year. I began noticing an area in the back corner of my backyard was slowly eroding away every time it rained (I am in the state of Louisiana, so lots of rain), and more recently the hole has grown to a very large size. In my closing documentation, it states that proper drainage was installed ""per Home Owner Warranty Act"" however clearly this is not the case, as every time it rains the water is slowly taking the earth away with it.

I have reached out to the builder with basically no luck, and all they have offered to do is fill the hole in with dirt for a ""cheaper"" price than what the going rate would be for a local contractor, but mentioned nothing about fixing the root cause, which is improper drainage. I brought out another independent contractor to evaluate the situation, and he pretty much told me the situation was pretty bad and gave me a quote for several thousand dollars to fix.

Do I have legal grounds to bring a lawsuit upon the builder? It has been under a year and this problem was brought on strictly due to there not being proper drainage in my lawn. Additionally, as the ground has eroded away, large chunks of concrete have been revealed, alluding to the builder just throwing all sorts of rubbish into the ground in order to build up the level of the yard during construction phase.

"Posting on Craigslist, do I need a lawyer? - Iowa. Long story short, my fwb and I broke up. It went terribly, was strung out over many months, and we're both left bitter about the whole situation.

I've also known about this for months. (this is essentially why we broke up). There was a posting up with the pictures he uses on his posts, and the text he uses on his posts, with a paragraph that essentially read: don't contact this dude, he's an alcoholic and gave me an STD and lots of trust issues. if you want a fwb on craigslist, reply to another posting. Also, his face is not in any of the pictures, and his name isn't any where on either of the posts (his original post, or the secondary post), so I don't think there is any way to identify who it is just from the posting.

So... today, he sends a screenshot to me and tells me he's suing me. He says it ""won't be for much"" and he ""hopes I learn a lesson from all this"".

"(Louisiana) I was involved in a car accident two weeks ago, should I get a lawyer?. Hello all. This is my first time posting here so I hope i'm doing this right. I was in a car accident 2 weeks ago (the other driver was at fault) and I had my 2 younger sisters in the vehicle with me at the time. We all suffered concussions  and various back and neck pains and the youngest (16) had a bruised lung and had to get 5 staples for a gash in the back of her head (she was ejected from the vehicle). After she came home from the hospital and the swelling went down, we also noticed she had teeth marks around the outside of her tongue and a couple of chipped teeth in the front of her mouth. I have also had to be out of work the last 2 weeks for recovery. We have already started the claims process (I had insurance as well as the other driver) and so far, everything seems to be going along okay. I have never been in an accident before, so i'm not familiar with the process or anything, but everyone I know has been urging me to seek out a lawyer and try to get compensation for pain and suffering for myself and my 2 sisters, and also to cover my time off, and any medical bills associated with the injuries for the accident. Is this something I should consider doing? Or should I bring it up to the insurance company first and see what they say about compensation before considering that route? Any guidance or advice would be wonderful.

"Old Apartment Charged Rent After I Moved Out. I live in Omaha, Nebraska. My old apartment charged me rent for the month of July, but my last day of residency was June 30th 2017. Due to another semi-unexpected expense, this overdrafted my account by a fair amount and I have so far been charged 2 overdraft fees and will likely have an ""extended overdraft"" fee added on before I am paid and can be back in the black. Rent was set up to be paid automatically through their web portal, and I had not cancelled it, thinking it was unnecessary as I had signed all the paperwork to move out. 

The property manager had called me July 3rd, telling me the automatic system had charged me, I went to my bank to try and stop payment, but it appears it was too late. I contacted my bank Friday to file a dispute, and then contacted the property owned Monday. They agreed to pay back the amount, but denied responsibility and so would not pay the overdraft fee, claiming it was my responsibility to cancel the payment. I wasn't happy with that, but $35 didn't seem worth the hassle and cancelled the dispute with my bank. Now that it is 2 fees, as a second bill came due before I was paid, and potentially a 3rd fee, I'm less inclined to accept that and considering my options, if I have any.

"[Denver, CO] What kind of proof of damages/costs is your landlord required to have to keep your security deposit?. I recently broke my lease and moved out of my house after about 9 to 10 months because the house had so many problems and the landlord refused to fix them.  The landlord actually agreed to terminate the lease early without penalty.  However, the landlord notified us that she's keeping our $4000 security deposit and sent a long itemized list of all kinds of repairs she made to the house with a blanket labor cost of $50/hr.  She charged the same labor cost for cleaning windows as she did for refinishing an antique wood vanity...  Although we've requested it, she has not provided any invoices or receipts for any of these repairs.  It seems that she just created a spreadsheet and assigned random dollar values and labor times/costs to all of these repairs, and possibly did them herself if they happened at all.  (The damages she says we're responsible for are completely outrageous considering we lived in the house for less than a year and are very tidy people, but that's beside the point of this post)  She also charged us $520 in locksmithing fees because she moved to New York with her only spare key and needed to hire a locksmith for her friend to show the house to potential tenants, but our lease stated to lock the keys in the house on move out.

However, I recently discovered that he has not made a single payment on the property since we split up in June 2016. The reason I wasn't notified earlier was because he changed the address they were sending past due statements to without my knowledge.

Our neighborhood does not have sidewalks or curbs, it just has road which turns into grass. In the past, they dug a large 4ft by 4ft hole in the middle of the road and only had 4 tiny cones, one on each corner, to mark the area. My boyfriend fell into the hole and luckily didn't hurt himself. I contacted the HOA and told them, and asked if they could please use taller cones slightly outside of the perimeter, and some type of caution tape so my boyfriend would hit that with his cane before physically falling into the hole. They apologized and did this.

What can we do? Are they allowed to do this? I don't want to sue anyone, I just want to know if they're required to mark construction in a certain way or not, and if they're doing it wrong I'd like to ask them to make sure it's marked correctly in the future.

There is no way I passed those tests. The attack passed by the 3rd test (balance test) which I was able to do fine, but I was not allowed to retake the previous two. 

Officer thought I was on some kind of narcotic, and brought me into the station. The did take a urine sample, which I'm positive will come back clean, I don't do drugs. I did have a few beers earlier that afternoon but this stop happened over 4 hours after I had drinks, and I did not have enough to even get buzzed.

This is my first OBI, I have no priors, and I have already spoken to a lawyer and have things in motion to meet before my arraignment hearing. What should I be expecting to happen here?

That is honestly fine by me, i just want some form of punishment for ""Tyrone"" so he knows that it's not okay to grab women who don't want to be grabbed.

The issue is my mileage from my home to the client's office isn't going to be considered an expense mileage I can get reimbursed for. He would like me to work from the main office once a week as well - not mileage.

"Woman claims my SO is the father of her four year old daughter.. So I know similar questions have been asked about this, but my current bf's situation is completely different and I can't talk to anyone about this and feel completely alone. 

My partner just got a call from a one night stand he had 5 years ago claiming he has a four year old child. (they worked together at the same company so she found his number through mutual friends on Facebook) Anyway, when she was 6 months pregnant she said to him that it might be his but then weeks later said it wasn't and that she had slept with two other men that same week and that he shouldn't worry. Well she called two weeks ago for the first time in 2 years and insisted it was his, wants child support and that he should come and do a paternity test immediately. My boyfriend only told me this yesterday, I've never seen him this nervous and upset. 

The problem is, is that we live in a different country now. Have been for 3 years.  So he would have to fly a 13 hour flight and pay for the expensive test. Well he doesn't have to but is scared she might go to court, convince them that its his and put a block on his passport or a warrant for his arrest. Probably would have to get lawyers involved as well. He has a job, responsibilities here and can't just leave. We're quite serious in our relationship and this might change every dynamic of it, I guess I'm just lost and he doesn't really know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.",0
"Court tomorrow regarding traffic violation; should I plead not guilty? Or guilty with an explanation?. A little back story here. I was given two tickets, a ticket for stunt driving and ticket for driving without consideration. Me and some friends were out in the industrial area of our town late at night(no houses in the next 10km). It's a pretty well known area of our town for people to come down and drift or race there cars . Cops have come there before and usually just make sure no one is drinking and driving, or say to go home, I've never seen a ticket issued. So at about midnight I was doing some doughnuts. We saw some head lights coming down the road, I moved into the parking lot and shut my car off. The officer drove behind me and turned his lights on saying he saw me burning out my tires ( there was over 10 people there all drifting in the same colour of car, could have been anyone of us but I'm owning the situation here). It was also raining so sound of tire squeal would be minimal. I got my car impounded for ten days, $200 driving without consideration ticket (which I disputed), a stunting ticket which I was unable to dispute, had to pay $600 in impound fees, and lost my license for 60 days. I feel I was treated excessively as this was my first ever ticket, no one was in danger or at risk, we've been verbally told to come down there if we want to do things like this by one officer instead of harming people on the streets. There's my spiel any help would be great .",0
"Is my landlord responsible for replacing person belongings that were damaged?. Hello r/legaladvice,

I am a college student who rents an apartment for school that has a year long lease. I just found out that my apartment was flooded with water (I live in an apartment complex, the tenant above me hung a coat on the sprinkler) and some textbooks and clothes of mine are now ruined. My landlord never contacted me about water damage in my apartment, and I only found out when one of my roommates called me telling me the apartment was trashed. They also completely tore up my bedroom, it now looks like a construction site in there. They never contacted me to tell me they were doing this, and they moved and mistreated all of my belongings in the process. My lease goes until August 1, but then they finally contacted me on July 11 (days after the water damage occurred) telling me I had to be out by July 14th so they could do construction. I went to my apartment to grab my things on July 12, and this is when I found out they already tore my room apart, and found my damaged textbooks and clothes.

Is there any compensation I can demand from my landlord? My belongings we're damaged in an accident I had nothing to do with, and I was not notified at all about damage/work they did. My roommate tried talking to them and they said they are not liable, and that we should have gotten renters insurance. I live in Pennsylvania and I do not have renters insurance. Please help.

"Employer is making me pay half of an employees driving ticket. Is this legal?. Last week myself and two other employees were riding from one part of our employers property to where our store is located. The drive is less than quarter of a mile.
Our work truck is a regular cab Ford F350. My two other employees hopped in the cab. Seeing as though it's a bit cramped with junk in the cab + two employees I decided to hop in the uncovered bed of the truck.
On our very short trip back to our store a NYS Trooper saw us and pulled a U-turn. I knew he was coming to stop us, but didn't think it was anything serious. Just a warning.
I ended up hopping out of truck and headed inside as did the passenger of the truck. The driver went to park our work truck and the Trooper followed him into our parking lot.
Turns out our employee was driving unlicensed(lost due to DUI) and without a seat belt. Originally we were stopped because I was in the bed of the truck. The police officer spoke with me, asked for all of my info and explain why I was stopped, but was not ticketed.
He ended up speaking to our other employee for well over 20 minutes and later gave him a ticket for driving without a seat belt and without a license.
Am I liable for paying half of this ticket when it has nothing to do with me? I'd understand if he was ticketed due to me being in the bed of the truck, but from what I read about our law I'm above the age where it's illegal and we were traveling less than the illegal distance.",0
"Landlord Requiring Full Carpet Replacement. Hi everyone, I'm seriously stressing over this, so thank you in advance for any advice. 

I'm a college student renting a townhome from a rental company with a huge monopoly on houses around the university. 

We are moving out in August and yesterday I got an email saying they inspected the house and will require the entire carpet to be replaced due to ""major stains or significant damage."" When I asked for clarification they said ""it appears that there is ripped and badly stained carpet on the stairs. There are also stains through the apartment, and a large tear in the carpets entering one of the bedrooms.""
I was aware of the final thing. Our cat thinned out the carpet in a 7 inch spot by my roommates door, but I have no idea what other issues they are siting. To add to this, I'm out of the state until the day we move out, so can't do a walk through with the landlords. 

The claim that they will have to replace the entire carpet seems insane to me. There is only carpet on the top floor and in the basement, so it is not all connected. Even if the issue is only on the top floor, am I still responsible for replacing the entire homes carpet? Or why they can't just replace the small spot? 

Extra background: 
We have lived in the place for 2 years, so it has been 2 years since a professional carpet cleaning.
The carpet was apparently last replaced in 2014 and I have in writing that they expect carpets to last 5 years.

Thanks for any help",1
"Legal recourse for vehicle insurance fraud. So last Thursday I was involved in a minor road incident in downtown Houston Tx. I was driving when a car turned left at an intersection and hit my tire. No body damage to my truck but the front of their car totally came off. Here's where it gets interesting: a woman was driving with her husband. Neither parties had a drivers license but the male had an ID and insurance. The cops got involved and only cited the male for driving without a license (again, he was passenger) and declared no one at fault. This now affords the couple of filing a claim against my insurance, which they have started. 
Other funny details: the entire front end was exposed but the officers let them drive away. Shouldn't it have been towed? Aren't they able to incur more damage after the fact and claim it against me? How can they drive away without a drivers license? The cops never took my side of the story and only took theirs into account.

I was involved in a similar incident last year and the driver was awarded 30k causing my progressive insurance to skyrocket from $130 full coverage to $670. I had to cancel that policy for some cheap roadside insurance policy that still costs me $230 a month. 

I'm petrified that it's about to happen again causing my insurance to soar making it unaffordable and possibly causing me to lose my truck. If that happens then I'd lose my job (I'm an independent contractor) and the snowball effect continues from there. 

Any advice?",0
"My dad just finished building a house to move in after my mom passed, the neighbouring farm decided to start building a giant barn blocking out his whole view.. Hey guys,

first of all I should say this is happening in Belgium.

My dad, after losing my mom and my sister, recently decided to move and build himself a new place, he picked a place mostly for the view in a remote village here in Belgium. Now the neighbouring farm started making plans for a giant metal barn right across the whole damn place 50 meters long, they're known to be intentionally mean here amongst locals, they told my dad it was gonna be placed in a way that would block the view much, that we would only see the width of it. Now the building permit got accepted and my dad could finally check it (he couldn't before) and it's the whole damn length of the thing, 50 meters long, right across the field. Now that the permit got accepted, we can't apparently do anything or at least that's what I'm told, on top of that in Belgium they generally let farmers build anything anywhere without much of a question's asked. These people have a lot (a lot!) of land and could place that barn virtually anywhere (including places where it wouldn't bother anyone obviously), they intentionally misguided for months my 70 year old dad and he's too nice to do anything. Is there *any* angle I could approach? This makes me sick in my stomach for him, he's just a nice old guy who wants to spend the rest of his life peacefully.

"Position is terminated after approaching boss &amp; HR about mental health struggles.. After moving to an open work space, my focus and attention struggles has really been exasperated and with a family history of mental health struggles I started accepting I might be no longer overcoming my own outside of professional help. I started seeking out help on my own accord knowing I needed to improve. In a meeting with my boss about my unsatisfactory performance, I disclosed to them I had just met with my physician to begin the process of getting help. 

I also reached out to HR that day seeking resources for help, if there were any. HR scheduled a meeting with me and my boss to understand my situation and during this meeting I had informed them that I was meeting with a therapist through EAP. 

Now, my position is being terminated and I was informed of this the day before my therapist appointment. Though I am bring offered a generous severance and the papers explicitly state this was a decision being made before I sought help from them, it's with an obvious condition that I have no legal options. 

I don't want to continue in my position, however I think this is a very questionable time line of events and I don't want this to happen to anyone else. Unfortunately I have not been officially diagnosed with anything - the earliest I could see an actual doctor in my area for this was going to be months in advance.

"My girlfriend's apartment has been infested with bees and roaches for months (among other issues). Her lease ends the second week of August but does she have any legal recourse here?. Her lease is/was only a 1 year lease so she hasn't been in this apartment long, but her apartment is absolutely infested. I'm talking you walk into the kitchen (without food, trash or dishes sitting out) and there's roaches crawling around everywhere. 

There's also the issue of the bees, which I guess nested right outside her window? We find many dead bees by her bedroom window, and often have to just ignore one flying around (or kill it but I feel bad killing bees lol). She's actually been stung twice now.

Finally the last major issue is a broken thermostat. The original thermostat in her apartment looked as though it was from the early 90s. A mercury one I think. It was broken throughout the year and it took until this past month for them to replace it.

Of course, they've put in work orders over these issues. She's has the ability to look at the work order history for her unit, but it appears either the apartment company's system changes the dates automatically or someone is changing them manually. One example is a work order she has a confirmation email (which she has for many others as well) is dated April 25th, and the work order system says the work order was submitted at midnight 6/20, and completed at 11 AM 6/20...

"My property manager is making my fix up my apartment for the next tenets on my own dollar. Is this normal or am I being played?. I've lived in my apartment complex for 2 years, there's no security deposit. I've kept the place in extremely good condition. I've even been a live in model for the complex. 

I'm moving out in two weeks and my property manager dropped off a packet for move out procedures. My manager wants me to repaint the house, get the carpets professionally cleaned, pressure wash the outside, and so on my own dollar. 

My place is VERY clean. I completely understand not leaving the place a mess! But to redo the entire place for the next tenants doesn't seem like a job I'm supposed to be doing. We have onsite maintenance teams and they always are outsourcing renovators for other units. I don't recall ever reading this in my lease (I'm going to go through it again though). 

They are offering a wildly expensive ""express check out bundle"" where I can pay $500 for them to do it all for me. That is nearly my monthly rent. This doesn't seem like it's my responsibility to be doing. Obviously I was going to clean the place, but to paint and pay a professional to pressure wash? 

I feel like my complex is ripping me off because I'm a student and ""don't know better"". Is this a normal procedure for moving out of a rental unit?

"AK - RV park Property Seizure advice. I currently work at an RV park up here in Alaska. We offer long term, monthly stays for people wanting to stay for months or years on end. It's kind of a common thing up here for RVers to do, as it's cheaper than paying rent at most apartment complexes and alot of times, when people move up here, they'll stay in an RV until they can find a home to buy. We've run into a hang up though we haven't had to deal with in the time we've owned the Park (2 generations). 


We have someone who owes a TON of back rent for there lot (2 months worth). We've attempted to get ahold of them, and we let them know we'd be moving there RV into our storage if they didn't pay something, or at least talked to us to arrange something.

"[Texas] Need help changing my custody agreement to keep my son in the state. We didn't have lawyers and went the mediator route, everything was pretty standard and even got a little more than most. I pay 20% for child support, I get him all summer, every weekend and Thursdays, most holidays, rotate Christmas break etc. 

We live in Central Texas and she is in school. When we were deciding where she could take him the options were this and surrounding counties or 'without regard for geographic location'. I didn't want to rule out Dallas and Austin since those are her best bets for work, that was the discussion we had and that was the understanding when I signed it - certainly no word about moving out of state. Now, however, she's threatening to move to Connecticut and laughing at me for being stupid and signing it - which....she isn't wrong. I was trying to think about her finding a good job so my son would have a decent place to live. Now it seems ""I've made a huge mistake"". 

We only have the custody and child support agreement at this point and neither of us have filed for divorce (she needed an operation and my insurance so we waited for that to be over with). 

What are my options in getting that one part changed in the custody agreement? Is that something that will be revisited when we get to the actual divorce?

"Apartments Ransom. Howdy folks, So a little over 4 months ago we decided to move out of our apartment. Unknown to us this complex required 60 days written notice before moving out. Ive only ever been required 1 months notice so this was unexpected. We failed to provide written notice which would have made our move out day concurrent with the end of our scheduled lease and ended up incurring month-to-month fees. Because of this I made a serious point to deliver written notice the next Monday. 

We have since signed a lease at another complex set to commence at the end of this month but are now being told by our current complex that they do not have a written notice on file for us, meaning they expect us to charge us full rent plus additional month-to-month fees (totaling around $3200). 

We will not have the financial ability to pay this total on top of our newly acquired rent. I have communicated this to the apartment management and was told I would receive a phone call to give me a final answer from the ownership. Have not heard from anyone yet. We went to the office today to try and get an answer but basically got told they aren't sure how to proceed, which I take to mean ""you'll find out at the first of the month."" which sounds like I'm about to be very hungry for the next 3 months.

"[Canada - Alberta] Trying to round up a place to roommate at for school starting September. The lease my landlord gave me seems a bit sketchy.. I was looking at a few places in Edmonton and settled on a place I agreed with, it's a 3 bedroom, 1 bath townhouse that I would be sharing with two other tenants. At the time of me moving in, there would be one other tenant living there until late August, and two new tenants coming in September to fill the now vacant rooms.

Reading through the lease, I noticed that the monthly rate seemed a bit sketchy, the room was listed at $530/month as described in parentheses, but the rent also describes the rent as $1590.00 a month, as a total of the rent from all three tenants.

The other two tenants are complete strangers to me, and I will meet them personally when I move in (I have had limited contact with them prior to receiving this lease), both will also be students.

My concern is that if either of, or both of the two other tenants decides to backout, or takes off mid lease, am I going to be saddled with paying the full rent amount of $1590.00?

Here's a censored copy of the lease, as well as an email from the Landlord themself, and my response:

Luckily i still have quite some time to find a new place if this seems overly sketchy. And if he responds saying the rent is only $530.00 a month I will ask him to change the lease to reflect that, or I am no longer interested.

"Father passed away. Hello. My father passed away a couple of months ago. He didn't leave much in the way of assets, but he did have a 401k with a little over $52k in it. 

My siblings and I weren't close with him, he wasn't a nice guy. My mother wants no part of anything to do with him.

So, I met with a local estate lawyer who was willing to handle everything, but he wanted a $3000 payment up front that would cover all costs associated. He said that if we were to put it on a credit card, we could get money out of the estate that he would be opening in order to pay it off before the next payment is due. My siblings and I, being young, don't have access to that amount of capital up front, and with my mother not wanting to get involved, I don't know what to do. 

So here are my questions:
1. Does this seem to be a fair rate for setting up an estate and handling all of the probate stuff
2. Are there any services that you're aware of that could pay the money up front for a fee, that we could pay back quickly from the estate
3. Is this something I could handle myself
4. Am I running out of time to do this

One of my siblings and I are adults, just young and in school. We don't want to miss out on this money, the only good thing our dad has ever really done for us as far as we are concerned. He listed no beneficiaries on his 401k and had no will. This is taking place in Michigan, and the lawyer came highly recommended by my mentor in the local chamber of commerce.

"[Virginia] Property Manager threatening to send my water bill to collections, never once received a bill or statement.. Per the lease agreement I am required to cover the costs of all utilities including water/sewage. The way it works is that I get a bill in the mail (optionally an e-statement, opted out), but the payments get sent to the property manager to be deposited in my apartment's account along with rent. The bill is supposed to come from the third party that manages the place. 

My first bill supposedly takes a few months, 2-3 months and not a day more according to the property manager, well it never came at all. After the 3rd month I walked into the office and talked to the property manager about why my bill hasn't showed up. She wasn't sure, so I asked if there's even a balance at all, there was. I paid what was due and was assured that this wouldn't happen again. Again after about a month I got no bill, told her still no bill, but she assured me it would come any day. 

So 5 months into my lease I get a notice on my door, soaking wet, stating my account will go into collections if I don't pay the balance. Not a single bill telling me this is an issue, despite countless times being reassured that I'd get one. Now I can pay the bill and I'll probably drop the check off tomorrow as it's not due for a few more days. This, along with a few minor issues, have become very annoying.

"Landlord wont let me bring my therapy pet next year. What are my options?. As a general rundown, I live in a college town where dogs are very rarely welcome due to students not taking care of their pets and not paying deposits. Unfortunately, this blocks good pet owners like myself from being able to keep their furry friends themselves. 

My therapy dog has been in my family for 8 years and came up to college with me as soon as I was able to bring her. This year, roommates and I agreed to move into a house for the next school year. Unfortunately, two of my roommates signed their part of the lease before I was able to read it over. When the landlord learned that I was planning on bringing my 5 pound poodle mix, he freaked out and would not let me sign my lease. He told the other two friends that they were stuck to a four bedroom house that they would have to split the rent between the two of them. After a week of pleading emails, he finally agreed to let me sign, so long as I signed a contract agreeing not to bring my dog or try to claim her as a therapy pet next year or I would be evicted. Normally I would be angry with people who sign at an apartment complex without planning anything for their dog, but I was in a bind where I had to help my roommates out and knew my family could take care of my dog if need be.

"Sword laws. Legal question regarding sword laws in California:

I am a native of Westminster California in Orange County. I have no criminal record and have little to no interest in owning a firearm personally. Where I live there are a lot of unfortunate homeless and/or folks suffering from drug addiction.

While I do not wish to own a firearm for myself, I am still interested in defending myself the best way I know how to. I have been classically trained in swordsmanship and do not feel confident in my skills with a knife. I am curious about how the law works regarding carrying a properly sheathed, fixed blade in the open when I walk my dog to the store and such and while what research I can find on the matter seems to suggest I can do so legally, they have seemed to be lackluster resources at best.

I feel I should further add:
1. No, it is not a katana. (not sure why I felt I needed to add that but there you go)
2. No, I am not a sword wielding lunatic wishing to go all Purge on people.
3. I have no want, desire or plan to harm anyone, and I truly feel for said unfortunate in my city.

Were it still not to discourage such advances, I would like to be able to confidently defend myself the best way I know how to.

Being in California she couldn't have used the New Hampshire insurance since it was only accepted at the university's medical network. She has proof that she was clocked in at work in California for the times associated with the claims.


The university states that all students (even those on a leave of absence must have health insurance that meets their requirements). Her leave of absence ended a month ago.


I've already read through the [FTC's medical identity theft](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0171-medical-identity-theft) page and plan to follow the instructions there. Is there anything else that we can do to solve this? What would be the best way to get the insurance cancelled?",0
"My California employer is moving from an accrued PTO to an unlimited PTO system and aren't paying out accrued hours.. Just yesterday an email went out from our CFO announcing we are shifting to an unlimited PTO system from an accrued vacation system as of August 1st. For the last two years I have accrued about three weeks worth of vacation, with coworkers accruing months over a longer time. A fellow coworker and myself both inquired about the hours being bought out to which our CFO replied: 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""No, it's not being paid out in the transition, it will just remain there"" 

and

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""won't be paid out, but we are figuring how we will / can treat it.""

&amp;nbsp;

He has not replied to us requesting what that means, and if that means the previously accrued hours will still be paid out upon leaving the company (rather than just being paid out when we switch systems). With an August 1st deadline, others and I can't burn all the hours and many were expecting those hours being bought out upon leaving. I know legally in California, a company whose PTO is based on accrued hours has to buy them out upon leaving because those accrued hours are a form of deferred compensation that cannot be taken away from the employee once it is earned. But now that we've switched systems, do they still have to pay out or are all of us workers getting screwed? If they have to pay out, are they able to pay out upon leave rather than upon switching systems?",0
"(FL) Having issues with Landlord........... Not fixing anything. Long story short. My landlord will not fix any issues regarding rental unit. I have lived here for 4 yrs and in those 4 yrs he has only fixed one problem, after 3 yrs of trying to get him to fix it, which was the shower hot and cold water. Before that, i would go buy repair kits to fix myself. Anytime someone is taking a shower upstairs, water will pour down into the living area. The section of ceiling has a hole and mold around the area where it comes from.
He knows about this, but will not address it. Also, there is leakage from the AC unit upstairs, leaks down to the landing behind the wall and has caused mold to form on the landing and on the floor at the base of the stairs. He claims that the skylight is leaking so its the HOA's problem. Carpet stays wet even if it isnt raining. Now onto the carpet. He installed what i call scrap carpet. Instead of one piece for the living area, it is in sections. Shortly after moving in, the carpet started to separate in the middle of the living room. His response....i should buy an area rug and cover it. The carpet has also separated, top from the bottom, so cleaning the carpet will not work.
So now we are battling over this and what is actually owed in rent, thats another tell for another day.
Question is, whom do i call to get him to fix these issues? I called the city and they said to work it out with the landlord. A lawyer is out of the question due to finances. Any direction will be helpful.",1
"Payment by personal check. Hey Everyone,

First off, I want to say that I believe this would be the best place for this, but if you know of a more relevant subreddit for me to go to please let me know! Also thanks for the help in advance.

Ok, so I'm 20 y/o, in Nebraska.  I'm working and paying my way through college. 

I am currently working a part time job in the afternoons 3-4 days a week for a cleaning service, Jane Doe's cleaning service (not the actual name).  I am getting paid hourly wages, every other week by form of a personal check. I have not signed any paperwork or anything like that, nor does she intend to have me sign anything. I keep record of my hours on a sheet of paper essentially. She's a very honest person, not shady at all, I've gotten to know my co-workers and there are no complaints or anything. Everyone is very friendly and have known each other for a while. 

She had told me during the interview that I would be paid like I previously described and would have to take out my own taxes and keep record of all that.

What I'm wondering is what I need to do legally for tax purposes since there is no paperwork that I have filled out, and she is paying me by personal check based on an hour sheet that I fill out every day.  Do I need to mark it down as work income, or do I need to mark it down at all??(kidding on that last part) 

I'm afraid to spend any of the money I have earned from the job just bc I don't know what I'll end up needing to do with it later on so all help is invited!!!",0
"[FL] Liability to multiple contracts if I sublease?. Hey fellow redditors. I am looking to sign a lease for the fall term at my university. Just yesterday I accidentally e-signed the first 3 pages of my lease because I was being dumb and couldn't find a way to view the entire lease without signing it. So basically I e-signed (1) a page stating my application info is accurate (which is the case), (2) a page stating that I agree to the rate and the start date of the lease and a statement saying I understand the total contract amount I owe is X (which I don't agree to, yeah I know yikes) , and another page (3) with the only relevant provision stating ""this Lease is between you and the owner."" 

So basically I just spoke with the property manager of this specified apartment complex and we both verbally agreed to a lower rate and earlier move in date, through subleasing from another person who decided they couldn't live there anymore, that wouldn't leave me with a gap between my current lease and the lease I partially signed. However, I did not mention that I signed the first three pages of the nonamended lease. Furthermore, I requested to only receive my Lease documents by paper. I know some shady stuff here, but I'm just trying to fix my $420 mistake.

So, anyways if I were to sign a newly drafted lease (the sublease) and I had signed those first 3 pages of the nonamended lease, would I be liable for both amounts/monthly rates?
What if he amends the second page? Or can he void the contract of those 3 pages?",1
"Credit card dispute for bad new tires while on road trip?. Dear r/legaladvice,

I recently was driving long distance when my tire blew out on the highway.  I put in the spare and drove to the nearest rural town but everything was closed since I got there on a Sunday.  I stayed overnight and in the morning went to one of the local tire shops.  They said my tires were old and all needed to be replaced (which turned out to be true), but that they only had two tires that were the right size.  So I got the two front tires replaced on my car and drove to the next nearest town to another tire shop that replaced the other two.  After my long long road trip I finally made it to my destination.  The next day one of the new front tires was flat.  I had to put the spare on again and drive it to Pepboys, and the folks there said the two front tires were the wrong size and poorly installed, and that the damage to the flat one was irreparable since it was probably poorly installed.  So basically I had to replace two brand new tires to get the correct size.  I will never go back to the rural town hundreds of miles away so I can't return the poorly sized and improperly installed tires, so I left them at Pepboys.  Anyway this has all been extremely frustrating and costly and I am totally unsure what to do.  Should I call the rural tire shop that screwed up and yell at them and demand a refund, even though I have no way of returning the tires they put on car?  Should I call my credit card company and dispute the charge from them?",0
"[DE/NY] Employment at will question. Hello - I am a IT consultant whose business is formed as an LLC in Delaware. I was providing services to a company in NY who further subcontracted me out to a company in NJ.

My question is related to employment at will and deception. 

I previously was consulting through my company with a law firm in NYC. I was not challenged enough so I made the decision to move on. The problem is that my decision was based on this new company telling me they had lots of work that would keep me challenged  and that has now turned out to be false.

I signed up to do one thing with the company and after I had started, they completely changed the scope of the project on me and I was doing something I didn't sign up for. Additionally, they told me they just needed me to do this thing first (which I did) and then they would get me going on what actually signed up to do.  That didn't happen, the project ended and I am now sitting here without a job, where as had I known what I was actually walking into, I wouldn't have the made the decision I made and could have still been working where I was or someplace else. 

What options do I have here?  I do have sufficient documentation showing what I signed up for. 

TLDR: Employment at will I made the decision to leave a company based on false information the new company provided. Project scope and length were completely fabricated. Had I known what I was actually walking into I wouldn't have made the decision I did and I would have still been employed.",0
"Need advice on a bed bug issue.. First off, this is in California. Here's the issue: we moved into our current apartment about 6 months ago. There were no signs of bed bugs and we did not have bed bugs. 6 months later we begin to find bed bugs and we contact our property manager. They inform us the owner will not be paying for treatment and it is our responsibility because he replaced carpets before we moved in. I've been doing lots of reading/research and I can't get a definitive answer on who is truly responsible for the treatment cost. Anyways, couple days later the landlord has a exterminator come out to inspect. Before he even looks around, he tells us ""the bugs came from your neighbor next door. She's had them for a long time and doesn't want to pay for treatment. She wants me to look inside but I'm not going it. It's pointless. I know she still has the bugs."" So now we know where they originated. Here's the part where it gets tricky. We signed a bed bug addendum when we moved in basically saying we understand the landlord believes there to be no bugs and we will not hold him financially responsible for treatment. Does that still hold up if we signed it under the impression there were none when the owners knew that there were? I want the place treated either way, but can the landlord hit us with the bill for treatment if it is known that they didn't originate with us? Do we need to go after the neighbor for the cost? Sorry for the long post, just trying to find answers before I start raising serious hell.",1
"Issues with paternity while legally married, my husband is not the father of my new child and we are separated but he is legally presumed the father.. I had no idea how to title the post well, because it's all very odd to me. I've been separated from my husband for over 4 years now. I haven't seen or spoken to him in over 3 of those years. I have no idea where he's living, and divorce has been complicated to try and start. This isn't about a divorce though. I just had a child with another man, and I didn't know anything about paternity laws in my state. I live in Oklahoma and found out after delivery that if I'm married my husband is the legally presumed father of my child and my childs actual father cannot be put on the birth certificate or be the legal father. I now know he has to sign a denial of paternity and the biological father has to sign an acceptance. The issue is, I have no way to get my husband to sign the form. To my knowledge, he's still living out of state in California but I have no idea where other than the state. What actions can I take to get him to sign this form? Is there any service that can help? Do I need a lawyer?

Edit: A nurse in the hospital suggested that if I absolutely cannot find him to go and file for child support against him because the agency could find him and he could come and deny paternity. I don't exactly think that would work because I'm not sure you can even get child support while still married, plus I know he's not the father and that would make the whole ordeal odd.",0
"Dish room at workplace is extremely hot, is it a violation of OSHA regulations?. I work for a restaurant in Michigan. The room where our dish machine is regularly gets up to above 80 degrees and 70% humidity. [Here is a photo of the temperature gauge in the room from today](http://imgur.com/a/jkIPM)  That was taken after the dish machine had just shut off for a brief ten minute period.

Our head of the building has begun to disallow us to have the doors to the room propped open while the machine is in use. These doors are at the hottest end of the machine. The ceiling vents do not work and on the weekends the air conditioner for the whole building is turned off anyway. There are two fans inside the room (there used to be three, one broke and was never replaced) that barely move the air around. 

I know OSHA states that there are no temperature regulations for workplaces. However it also says that OSHA kicks in when there is a possibility for heat related illness. Spending 20 minutes in the room leaves you coated in sweat and the head of the building does not allow us to keep cups/water bottles in the dish room. We're told we have to go get water from the pop machine, but cannot do that when the dish machine is in use. Serving on 700 people on the regular in a 2 hour period means the machine is constantly in use. We constantly need to rotate people out of the room because they begin to get light headed from the oppressive heat inside the room.

"I broke a lease six years ago and haven't paid it off. I broke a lease (I was never served a notice to vacate) with an apartment in Texas.  They charged me for the remaining months, and added all concessions from the previous months.  The balance is somewhere near $5,500 and is definitely on my credit report.

"I was issued a citation for alleged property damage from a university in Texas. I was issued a $250 citation from a university in Texas after hitting a gate arm and knocking it off. 

Gate arms here stay open long enough for multiple cars to pass through because the area is open and doesn't require special access. At the beginning and end of the workday It is common for the arms to stay up for 30 minutes as people pass through. Except for an entrance that is perpendicular to the entrance I usually take. 

This entrance lets you into the same exact area as the normal entrance so I followed a car through like usual only for the arm to come down as I was passing the gate point. The point of impact was my windshield meaning the gate was no more than 25% closed by the time I was passing through

The gate arms are held on by plastic nuts designed to come off in the event of a car striking them and I know that there was no damage to the physical arm itself. I tried appealing the citation but it was upheld and I don't have a choice other than to pay it. The appeal process never gives you the option to talk to the ""appeal board"" or any sort of judge however

I wanted to find out if it would be worth going to small claims court to get some of the money back seeing that there was not(imo) $250 of actual property damage in my opinion. The plastic nuts that would have popped off might cost $5 max. If I had rammed through a closed gate I would agree that $250 was justified but something like this I feel is a $30 mistake at most ",0

"[CT] Indiegogo campaign collected funds for vaporware product, tried bait-and-switch, no longer responding to emails requesting their legal department details. Last year, myself and hundreds of others put our money down on a product called a ""Marble DCS"". The company is an established company with another successful product. The ""DCS"" was offered in two versions, the DCS-1 and DCS-2. 

The promised ship date or the DCS-1 was October 2016. Units were finally being reported as received by backers in May 2017, 9 months after the promised ship date.

I've been trading emails with their support asking for an ETA on when the DCS-2 will ship, or asking them to refund the money they've already collected a year ago from backers. 

Their only responses are continued emails asking me to change my order to the DCS-1, instead of ""waiting for"" the DCS-2. The DCS-1 will not work for me, nor hundreds of other backers who paid for theirs.

I have lived at my apartment since last August, with the lease expiring at the end of July. Once they started taking renewals, maybe around November, they really pushed on the theme of not moving. They posted fliers on everyone's door saying something like ""Avoid the cost of moving. Renew today!"" showing the costs of moving trucks, security deposits, etc. added up. Also, on their website, it encourages people to renew and says sign your lease to stay in your apartment for another year. Under the impression that I could avoid moving, I renewed my lease around early June.

Fast-forward to today, I get a call from the leasing office informing me that I will be force-transferred, so that they can consolidate units and turn my apartment. Their reasoning for doing this was that I was the only person in my four bedroom apartment to renew my lease. They want to move me to a different unit within the complex. I will get two weeks to clean my current unit and move my new stuff into my new assigned unit.

In the lease, it states that the apartment reserves the right to change my unit at anytime.

She started off the chat sending a nude from the neck down. They chatted suggestively and she sent another nude.

 He then made a reference to her age and asked if she's just saying she's 18 because she thinks guys like ""younger"" girls, thinking she was probably much older (mid 20s-30s). She then went, ""im actually 17.""

However, she has managed to get an attorney through a women's legal center somehow by lying about me and how I have treated her.  When, in truth, I endured about 10 years of mental/emotional abuse from her before I decided the marriage could not be saved. 

Now that she has an attorney, and I don't, she is trying to ""stick it to me"" with a vengeance.  She has kept the children from me on occasion (to be vindictive) when it was my rightful visitation time, and she also says negative things about me to our daughters.

Are any of you aware of lost cost / pro bono options for a father that has been taken advantage of but is still trying to do the best he can for his children?   It doesn't seem fair that she can lie and get an attorney for free, and I, the law abiding father that has never missed a child support payment and see my kids as much as possible, can't?

Thank you in advance for your time, I appreciate any advice you can offer that might help me find an attorney, or an organization that could help me find an attorney.",0
"Bat in my apartment (Minnesota). So last night around 11 o'clock me and my fiancé heard a chirping and we looked to see our cat playing with a bat. We killed the bat and brought it in to the U of M emergency veterinary services for testing to see if it had rabies. We also brought both of our cats in to a vet to get rabies boosters this morning to further ensure they don't get the disease. We haven't heard back from the U of M yet, but I'm wondering if our landlord can be held responsible for any of the fees since it is either their fault for the bat getting into our apparent through a crack in our walls, or it got into our apartment because they leave both of the front doors and all of the fire doors open at night causing the bat to get into the building,and then sneak through our front door. We asked our maintenance guy about the situation and he said this was the second incident this month and they are calling an exterminator next week. Apparently this has been an on going problem and no one has told us. We're going in on Monday to see if the landlord will cover at least part of the vet bill. Do they have any responsibility to cover the bill legally or are we just stuck with the bill if they refuse? The initial bill for the booster shots plus all of their extra fees was $250 or so, but this will get much more expensive if the test for the bat comes back positive for the rabies virus, especially since we suspect that it was in our house overnight while we were sleeping so then we will need to get treatment. Any advice is appreciated.",1
"Being sued in small claims in another state over vacation rental chargeback. I live in Ohio and last year used a vacation rental site to book a few days at a house in Mexico. A few days before my trip, the property owner called to say there may be some work happening at the home I rented and that he'd need to put me up at a much larger home nearby. The house was larger but most of the amenities were non-existent or non-functional - including locks on the exterior doors.

When I arrived back, I spoke with the vacation rental site and they said to file a dispute through my credit card as I had been subject to a ""bait and switch"". I did so and the credit card company quickly refunded my money.

Today I was served with a summons to appear in a small claims court in San Francisco - apparently where the owner of the property lives. I've never been to San Francisco and the rental was in Mexico. The claim says that I falsified receipts with the credit card company in order to win my dispute.

A little bit of sleuthing leads me to believe that I can write a letter to the court explaining that because I don't live in the county (or the state for that matter) that they'll be able to just drop the case. **Should I write a letter explaining why the venue is wrong?**


I didn't provide any receipts at all to the credit card company. I simply explained what I experienced and they said I was right to dispute and that the merchant didn't respond to their inquiry with him so they took the money back. **Is there anything else I should be doing?**

"[Illinois] Talking to states attorney (Driving on a suspended licence + failure to yield at stop sign). **Background** 

August of 2016, I was ticketed for driving without insurance and for speeding.  I went to court and was given a fine and the ticket was removed from my record  for good behavior.   The speeding ticket was thrown out.    

Two weeks ago, I was pulled over for failing to yield at a stop sign. I was also ticketed for driving under a suspended licence. 
My car was impounded  due to the traffic stop.   I did not know the reason for my drivers licence being suspended. 

I contacted the dmv as soon as I could to find the reason i was suspended.  I found out when I changed insurancce companies I neglected to add the sr-22 to my insurance plan.    I quickly got it corrected.   

**Plan**

I dont have any money for a defense attourney. My court day is August 21.  I plan to go Tuesday during open session to get this sorted out, 

Here is what I am planning to do 
1.  Bring proof that I had no lapse in insurance.
2. Explain that when I got new insurance I neglected to get sr-22 due to thinking it was automatically added by the system.
3. Explain I would have never driven if i knew my licence was suspended. 
4.  I was not sure if i should bring this up.  I am going to vietnam to volunteer teaching children English.  This is my biggest concern  that i will no longer be able to go. 

How should I handled talking to them? Should I answer only questions presented? Should I ask to explain my situation first?
Any tips would be greatful!!",0
"Mechanic ripped my mom off. Hi,
Not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post, but here's my story.

My mom hears some flipping noise when driving, so she takes her car to firestone tires.(where she bought her tires)

1. Firestone- recognized that 2 tires were recalled, so they replaced 2 tires for free. Problem still persisted.

2. Mobil- So then she takes the car to the gas station the next day and the guy says the problem is the AXLE BOOT and STRUTS. Left side on the front was leaking. They said they would have to replace all 4 axles for total of $780. She says nope too much.

3. Valero- next my mom takes the car to the Valero gas station down the street and repeated everything that just happened, and he said that he will order the front STRUTS(not the entire axle) and get the problem fixed, and he won't do the back ones. 
So at the end, he replaced the entire left axle(leaking)(which never told her he was gonna do) and front struts, total $480. 

THEN AT THE END, HE SAYS THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THE BACK TIRE WAS THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE.
The other used tire in the back was ""feathering"", causing the noise. ($50 problem)

So he misdiagnosed, overcharged, and replaced parts that never needed replacing in the first place.

So tomorrow we are gonna get the original parts as evidence that they were not the problem nor they were damaged.

Also, the receipt invoice does not say anywhere the diagnosis of the problem. He never looked at the car, just did what he felt like basically. 

So she wants a refund of her money. Any suggestions??",0
"Falsely accused of being suicidal. I recently went to purchase a new firearm and I was denied. I have a clean record. So I called the local police to see what the issue is. They responded with saying ""on the Attorney General's database I'm listed as suicidal by another towns police department."" Next I called that town that has me falsely listed as suicidal ( mentally ill). The lieutenant in that town told me ""he will not remove the suicidal listing unless he gets a court order."" I then questioned him on how and why he's doing this. He said ""it had to do with a case I was involved in durning 2014."" That case was a misdemeanor vandalism. I received a one year filing, then the case was expunged. At no point did anything ever come up about being suicidal or mentally ill. I told the lieutenant ""how do you have proof that I'm suicidal? No doctor, psychiatrist, or professional in the mental health industry made any of these decisions."" He responded with I will not remove it unless I get a court order. At this point I realized he's just gonna keep giving me the same answer.  

My constitutional right to bear arms is being revoked from me because of his lie.   Also when this vandalism case happened in 2014 the police took all my firearms and ammunition from me then gave it all back after we were done in court.   If this officer really thought I was suicidal why did he give me back nine firearms and a bunch of ammunition?

What do I do to clear my name?  It seems like I have to sue the towns police department.  Also what kind of case do I have here?",0
"Company is using mandated lunch break time for meetings and not giving another break. Hey Reddit,

So a friend of mine works as a cook in some big sort of conference center thingy.  Before getting into the issue at hand I want to preface that we are from California and there are established laws in our state regarding mandatory meal breaks.

Ok so onto what is going on.  My friend has told me that on several occasions, employees have been required to attend meetings during their lunch period.  They cannot bring food into this meeting and they are not given any other time during the day to eat.  I know in California, it is required that you receive a 30 minute meal break after 5 hours of work unless a shift is only 6 hours.  From what I understand, the company sometimes works around this by making employees clock out early yet not actually take a break, so that on paper they appear to be getting their break and then having them take the break much later in the day.

The final issue I was curious about, is that apparently, said company is counting restroom breaks as the employee's 10s and 15s.  And im not talking about a lengthy bathroom break.  From what I am being told, if nature calls and you arent on break, you use your break.  So if you need to pee and it takes 3 minutes, say goodbye to your 10 minute break.

Any help or comments on the legality of these practices is appreciated.  From what I understand, her division doesnt really have any HR to go to, just an office manager with no real power over how things go.

Anyway, thanks Reddit!",0
"My landlord wants an additional months rent after the 1 year term ends. Hi r/legaladvice

I have a 1 year lease from August 27, 2016 to August 31, 2017. I can't find a single mention in the lease about procedures for terminating the lease at the end of the initial term. There is a section about ending the lease in a holdover, periodic tenancy period, such as month to month, which states that written notice of intention to vacate must be given and the lease will then be over at the end of the second complete month after notice. 

I emailed my building manager and the company leasing person on June 21 stating my intention to vacate at the end of the lease, August 31. They acknowledge my message and sent me a company specific ""notice of intention to vacate"" form to complete and return. I returned the form on July 7 (no excuses, I forgot for a while), and the leasing agent now says I am responsible for an additional months rent in September because I gave late notice within 60 days of my desired move-out. However, this was not a periodic tenancy that this rule might apply to, I did give written notice prior to 60 days anyway in the form of my email, and the lease made no mention of it needing to be given via their own specific form.

In short, I believe they are now making up rules or trying to stretch and apply ones that shouldn't be relevant to get an extra months rent out of me when they have no legal or reasonable grounds for doing so. Any thoughts on how best to proceed in a way they'll take seriously and back off of these demands?

Thanks!",1
"Work contract questions in Manitoba/Alberta. Hey everyone. I'm not sure where to look for information, or what to search for. I've tried a bit, and found some information, but not complete. 

So here's the situation. 

I'm 8 months pregnant, my husband went to work for a company to go tree planting for a couple of months. 

Turns out it's a shitty company and he wants to leave early. He told the boss that he needs to come back to help me, as I'm on sick leave currently. 

His boss said two things that are making me scratch my head. 

1. He needs me to provide a sick note detailing why I'm sick and what's wrong with me. I told my husband that in the note I provided my employer, it didn't say anything about why I am sick, just that I am sick and that I will be off work from this date until this date. 

2. Then he said that if my husband leaves now, instead of paying per tree, my husband will get paid minimum wage for the hours worked. My husband also said that he can stay for one more week. 

My husband doesn't have a copy of his contract, and will talk to his boss tomorrow to get a copy. 

I'm just wondering about the legalities of leaving a contract early, and if the boss can change the rate of pay in this situation. 

Also I tried looking into family sick leave in MB, and I found a phone number I can call to ask more. Unfortunately tomorrow is Sunday and I may have to wait until Monday to call. 

Also if he is in a different province, what provinces labour laws should he be following, assuming this company is a MB company? 

Thanks in advance.",0
"[MO] Driveway is sinking on a new house. Options and next steps?. Hey LA, 

I am posting on a throwaway just in case. I am looking for advice and intelligent next steps on getting this issue resolved. 

My partner and I built and bought a townhouse from a builder here in MO. Custom built, finished and closed end of Dec 2016. The driveway was poured in December. In March/April we noticed the driveway started to sink and part of it started popping up and separating from the ground. 

I email the warranty people at the builder, and they said the best they can do is pack underneath the driveway to keep it from sinking more. 

Well I went out and measured today and on one side it has separated 2 inches from the driveway and the other side is 3 inches. Upon some fun googling (which is probably not accurate), but a driveway should not be sinking or settling that much in this short of a time frame unless something was faulty with installation or the land they put it on. It's to the point of stopping our cars as we roll up the driveway in to the garage. We are worried about something underneath causing it to sink this quickly, resale value, and a potential accident by having to give a decent amount of gas to get up over that bump. 

What are the next steps to formally request or provide evidence that they installed it incorrectly? Should we get an inspector? Just email the warranty woman back letting her know we need to escalate? I just don't want to be railroaded. They've ignored my emails about issues before or just repeat the same shit back.

"Employment Contract - Need help. TLDR backstory: So my wife has been offered an anchor/reporter job that's a big break for her in her field.  However, the location is far from ideal (Southern Michigan) and it has limited jobs in my field (BioEng).  Her offer is a two-year contract agreement with 90-day probational period, however we're not sure of her rights to leave there after those 90 days.  The contract states:

""Your first 90 days of employment is a probationary period.  During this period, the company will evaluate your suitability for your position and it may decide not to continue your employment for no reason or for any reason prohibited by law.  You are free to resign your employment with the Company at any time either during your probationary period or thereafter. **This paragraph does not apply to individuals who have been employed by the Company or affiliate for more than 90 days immediately preceding the date of this offer letter**

You represent that you are not subject to the terms of noncompetition, confidentiality, or similar agreement that would limit your ability to carry out the duties of your position and your offer of employment is based on this representation. If the Company learns that you are currently subject to any such agreement that would limit or prohibit you employment with the Company, your employment may be terminated.""

Based on that, is she able to leave early without penalty a year down the road if she doesnt like it?  Could she accept a different job in the same field without violating her contract?

"[MA] Personal Injury Lawyers - ""Discovery of Harm""? Or - Help with disability claim?. Almost 20 years ago, an extremely fucked up series of events happened to me in public schools:    

1.) A school administrator assaulted me in his office (grabbed me by the throat and slammed me against the wall, didn't stop choking me until another teacher who was present physically removed him)    

2.) Another student pulled a stupid prank and blew up a toilet. I happened to be in the bathroom at the same time. Charges were pressed against both of us, and we were both suspended indefinitely. I spent almost 2 years awaiting trial. The trial lasted 15 minutes. The judge grilled the DA for wasting everyone's time.    

3.) Started going to school in the next town over. Was brutally beaten by a student, perhaps as a ""hazing"" ritual - I had never seen him before.    

4.) Dropped out of school and started using. Spent the rest of my life as a high functioning addict - until 16 months ago.    

5.) Got sober, subsequently had a serious mental break down, was hospitalized, diagnosed with several severe mental illnesses.
Not sure if there's any lawsuit here. It's all super fucked up but it was also so long ago. If that idea is dead in the water, what can I do about the fact that I keep getting denied when I put in disability claims? I really can't work more than 2 or 3 days/week and even then I still have days where I just can't.    

Appreciate any help, even if it's just pointing me in the right direction.

"Maintenance hasn't made repairs since I moved in.. I moved into a townhome back in May with my three year old son. The company that owns the property is a nonprofit and the leasing office is responsible for two other properties nearby. The day I signed the lease, I did a move-in inspection with one of the women who worked in the leasing office. I wrote down all the items that needed to be repaired/replaced (weather stripping on the front door, broken porch light, washer/dryer inoperable, bathroom door off the hinges, etc.) and signed that as well. I really needed a place as my son and I were essentially homeless, and rent here is cheap being that the property is owned by a non-profit company. Since, in my opinion, none of the needed repairs made the home uninhabitable, I moved in anyway figuring they would be fixed later. 

I've called the maintenance hotline multiple times, and they have come to my apartment to repair a leak so they are aware of what needs doing around here but every time I ask when are they going to fix my washer/dryer I get an arbitrary time frame (""the manufacturer technician will be there soon"" ""some time next week"", etc) but he never comes. I last spoke to maintenance two weeks ago but the last time they were out here was a month ago. At this point it seems they're either completely ignoring my requests or prioritizing other units over mine. Where should I go from here?

"Finally leaving husband. Hi there!  I'm looking for anyone who may have gone through a similar situation to what I'm about to go through and can tell me what my options might end up being.

Here's what I have now:
A husband who at best doesn't care about me and at worst is emotionally and verbally abusive to me.
A young daughter who relies on me for everything, and who my husband and I both love dearly.
A job lined up 2000 miles away in AZ (my home state).
Two amazing friends who are willing to help me get from here (GA) to AZ and get me set up there.

My biggest issue now is that if I make the move and take the job, I'll have to leave my daughter behind.  I won't be able to immediately afford to take care of her, and I know long-distance divorces and custody battles can be particularly nasty.  What I'm worried about is that it will look like I abandoned her- otherwise, I can almost guarantee I'd get custody.  I've been wanting to get away from my husband for a long time- my anxiety and depression have run rampant here with him, and I'm at the end of my rope.

I have no family here I can go live with, they're all either just as toxic as my husband or in no position to be taking me in.  I haven't left previously because moving takes money, which requires a job, and this job is the first I'll ever have, if I take it.

My options here are to stay and be miserable until I can manage to get a job that will support myself and my daughter, or I can go, be happier with my life, but leave my daughter behind.

Any perspectives on the legal aspect of all this?",0
"Employer had me go to ER, stuck with bill? [Kentucky]. While working as a housekeeper at a private country club, I got Tilex in my eyes. Before this incident, we were not provided with eye safety goggles, though a request had been made about masks of some sort because of the smell. 

I flushed them out and immediately sought out my general manager, who had me flush them out again before sending me to the emergency room down the road. I was in and out in 20 minutes with a prescription for eye drops. I didn't actually receive any medical treatment, just was told by someone in scrubs that I did what they were gonna do and was sent home. 

My general manager only gave me the incident report that she filled out about what happened and her card with information on it to take with.

"Leasing office unable to replace AC unit &amp; dishwasher for 30 days in apartment. (California). 

For the last 32 days both our AC unit and dishwasher have both been out of service. Also for the last month local temperatures have been ranging from 75-102 daily - including two week long heat waves where the weather wouldn't be lower than 80 at 10:00pm at night. 

They did install a temporary AC unit but it literally only cools within a 5-foot radius of the thing and doesn't reach any of the three bedrooms or kitchen. I bake as a part-time job from home and spend upwards of five hours at a time in front of the oven which is miserable in this heat. 

I just got an update that they'll be installing the new dishwasher (that's been sitting on our balcony in its box for the last three weeks) next Wednesday the 19th. Apparently they haven't had the man power to install it. 

We pay $2,765 for a 1,192 sq foot apartment. Our energy bill last month was $206.09, compared to our usual bill ~$130.00 - because of constantly having to run the temporary AC unit. 

I told them about our high energy bill and they offered to credit our account $300.00 - which covers our PG&amp;E Bill and (1) day of rent which calculates to $91.16). Not only that but because it's already mid-July I'm positive we'll be expecting another ridiculous energy bill.

"Should I my former university/employer? (Canada). I lived in and worked as an RA in a very old building when I was at university.

I haven't really been the same since then. I've always had bad headaches on a daily basis but I starts sleeping poorly and had more really bad headaches after this. About a year after this happened I basically had a migraine for three months, had to stop school, and developed an eye droop. 

No one could figure out what was the matter, I had scans, blood work, etc. They still couldn't figure it out so said it was likely complications from severe headaches for too long. I was put on pills and Botox injections. 

A few months after that I began having neurological problems, confusion, memory problems, my handwriting got really small, and I had to stop university for the second time. Once again nothing could be figured out. I had more MRIs and even a spinal tap and nothing was found. Thy said it may have partially been a complication from one of the headache drugs. 

I live in pain everyday. I take pills at breakfast, supper and night, I'm just now attempting to finish the degree o should have over a year ago. My life has changed completely. Even though I'm in Canada the medication still costs a lot. I don't get to be young anymore.

"I was the victim of accident with a car on my bicycle (Oregon). I was riding down a street in the bike lane. There were cars to my left and one turned right into a driveway cutting me off. They were close enough to me that I had to slam on my breaks or else I would slam into the car. I went over the handle bars and landed on the asphalt right next to their car. I sustained no major injuries but cuts and contusions and I'm going to have a hard time walking for a little while. My bike kept going and it got run over by their car being completely destroyed. The driver was immediately apologetic and claimed responsibility. They provided me with their contact and insurance information. 

So my problem here is I'm not exactly sure how to proceed. I'd prefer not to get lawyers involved because she was extremely nice and wanted to work with me on this. I do want her to pay for my hospital visit and a replacement to my bike. My bike I bought new and got it in a rare situation of the bike needing to be sold because it was a year old model and got it for about half the msrp with also haggling. I'm pretty sure I can't get a bike like that again for the price I paid for it.

My main questions:
1. I have not been in a situation like this before. Do I call her insurance right away and report the situation?
2. What do I tell them? (Might sound silly but I don't to say anything wrong that will prevent me from getting covered)
3. Can I provide them with the make and model of my bike to get the msrp value for it instead of receipt value?

My dad is an absolute wreck. He believes he has ruined our families reputation, is going to be hauled off to prison because its his word against theirs and they have three witnesses. 

We have been in contact with lawyers and they just told him to lay low and not worry about it. They said worse case the cops might come by and talk to him. Urinating in public isn't a sex crime here in Oklahoma either.

"[Florida] Is it legal for a non-profit 501c3 company to host their main event In Canada?. There are several redflags to this but I will make it as short as possible (also apologies if this doesn't go here)

The corporation is filed as a 501c3 which I know because I looked it up and found the paperwork, however, they publicly announce themselves as a non-profit under 501c7 status which is untrue. Their ""Organization"" is an artist collective/fan club for a TV show which benefits absolutely no charity nor is it fitting under the definition of a 501c3 non-profit. 

Their ""main event"" isn't a fundraiser it's basically a convention where they have some how hired celebrities to appear to do photo ops and autographs but once again if they do profit from this (and by current figures they most likely won't) they still have no charity indicated as a beneficiary and refuse to address why they are listed as a 501c3 instead of a 501c7 as they claim

They are based out of Florida but they are having their one and only event in Toronto. 

Is any of this legal? At all? Why would someone do this? Is this fraud or just utter incompetence? Obviously at this point I am aware I should not give them money (nor should anyone else) but people are still giving them money because ""YAY TV SHOW"" and I'm a bit nervous about the fallout of this should they keep going. Not for them but the fans and the celebrities they have conned into coming to their convention when their current budget projections very much show they already cannot afford 5 celebrity guests unless lying or fraud is involved.",0

While he was doing this, he struck up a conversation with a guy and they exchanged numbers, he texted him for ""shits and giggles"" supposedly.

What are the repercussions for this? I'm sure it's illegal to some point, but what action could this guy take against him? Thank you everyone. I very much appreciate any help offered here and I'm sure as hell that he will too...lol. You can save the ""what is he, gay?"" Comments, I've already given them to him twenty times over. Here are the messages that the guy sent to my friend:

""Can we FaceTime? If that's okay""
""Are you hiding something?""
""Okay, I'll ask you the last time before I take action against you""
You have fifteen minutes to confess what you've done""
""Bro, why. Like you know you would've been caught.""

My buddy didn't reply to any of these and has declined calls from this man, which I believe is the right move but I could be wrong. Thanks again for any help.",0
"Employer is trying to ""prepay"" my wage to force me to come to work for my last 2 weeks. I work at a minimum wage service job and put in my two weeks on Monday last week. As the usual two-week courtesy notice would have it, I would typically work until my last usual shift which is this Saturday. However, I told him in writing on my two-week notice that I only want to work til this Thursday (two days from today), which is kinda like a one and a half week notice. To get me to work the last couple shifts, he claimed two things (in person)  

1) I need to show up to work because ""I already paid you for those hours, so you need to show up for them"". and  

2) ""I need to give you your last paycheck on your last day"" in exchange for my uniform.  

...now for the record I think I know the real reason as to why he's doing this. A number people are leaving for vacation during this time (which is why I couldn't request time off myself in the first place) so he kinda maybe needs me. I also know that I have a direct deposit with the company, so the ""hand me my paycheck thing"" seems pretty bullshit. At the very least, I know he's heavily bending the truth, either too proud to tell ask me straight ""Hey I know you wrote you wanted to give me one and a half weeks, but I really need you this weekend."" or just hoping I'm gullible enough to believe whatever he claims.  

Or is he? That's what I want to ask you guys.  

Is he legally able to indebt me with ""wage prepayment"" and as a side question, how bullshit is his need to ""hand me my check on the last day""?  

Thanks for your time.",0
"Hospital in Louisiana refuses to bill my insurance company (Iowa medicaid). I visited the E.R. in Louisiana and am being billed (around $1,000) by the hospital who refuses to bill Iowa medicaid.  I've spoken to the insurance company that I have a policy with through medicaid and they agree I was covered and they have been willing to pay the bill, but the hospital must send them the bill.  The hospital insists they have no mechanism to send a bill to Iowa medicaid.  My bill was sent to a collections agency who were actually much more helpful than the hospital.  They facilitated a 3 way call between myself, the insurance company and themselves (collections).  We all came to the mutual understanding that I had fulfilled my obligations and that the hospital needed to bill the insurance company. Collections has since stopped contacting me completely, yet I still receive bills from the hospital.  I've tried speaking to the billing supervisor, and the people in billing have refused to let me speak to a supervisor, and just today sent my phone call to a customer service rep after telling me they were transferring me to a supervisor.  The hospital at one point even sent me a form so that I could bill my insurance company.  I filled it out and sent it to my insurance company and was told by my insurance company that it wouldn't work, and that they needed a bill from the hospital and not me.  I don't want this to hurt my credit, and I'm not sure what to try next.  Should I try a lawyer in Louisiana or Iowa? Is there some easier way to go about this?  Thank you for any advice.",0
"[NYC] My ex won't pay rent, but she won't leave either. What do?. Ex and I were together for a decade. Ex broke it off two months ago. Fine. Ex says she'll remove her stuff from the apartment and get on with it.

Except the part where she never did. And she stopped paying rent.

We are co-tenants on a lease that ends in approximatemy four months. Out of the eight months we have been here, ex has only paid rent for three. 

Because we were together so long, there is only a verbal agreement of splitting the rent in half. Maybe there's a saved text or something but I never got a written contract because love I guess.

The main thing here is I can't stand being around her anymore. We had a domestic violence incident in the last year that I did not report. Staying in this apartment now is mentally and physically destroying me but I don't trust ex to 1) not steal my shit and 2) not wreck the apartment.

The only silver living here is that the landlord allows for leases to be broken with notarized signatures of both co-tenants. I've sent this is ex multiple times and they've yet to complete it. To be fair, I haven't done it either because I've been waiting on her to sign it first. 

My main question is:
Is there any way I can potentially just get my name off the lease? This leaves ex with the hot potato, as they say, and is the easiest way to dodge. I'm just worried about this coming back to bite me in the ass later either via a small claim or a bad landlord reference. That's probably out of the question, though, considering the early leave. 

Thanks for any help you can give.",1
"I was charged with possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, how fucked am I?. I want to make this short so people will read this and give me advice, cause I've never been in this much trouble before.

I'm a 19 y/o male college student, and I was arrested a week ago while sitting in my car in a neighborhood near my house (I was alone). Cops searched my car and found my mason jar, which contained:
 - ~14 grams of marijuana (in two different bags)
 - A pea-sized amount of wax (hashish), with a paperclip
 - A grinder
 - 3 packs of rolling papers
 - A small bag of tobacco
 - A paintbrush that smelled of marijuana (I used it to clean my grinder)

I stupidly lied to my arresting officer when he initially asked if I had drugs in the car, they searched my car with probable cause, and after that I was cooperative. The cop asked ""why did you lie to me?"" then said ""Nevermind you don't have to answer that"" so I never admitted to having knowledge of the marijuana (not that it matters.. I was my car).  Also, I had not been smoking that day, and the officers knew that (they let me drive my car home after they booked me), so DUI isn't an issue.

I was charged with a misdemeanor. I have already hired a lawyer, and he contacted my arresting officer, and the officer agreed to bring it down to a disorderly conduct. But, my lawyer said I was going to have trouble getting the District Attorney to agree to that due to the amount and the wax/rolling papers.

Any advice or sympathy would be much appreciated, this is my first brush with the law and it's really scary. Thank you in advance!!",0
"[Colorado]. I live in the wonderful state of Colorado, but recently I have come under fire from one of my ""friends"" whom I let stay at my place for an extended period of time. The guy was having a rough time figuring out his life, and I offered to help him. He moved in with me, and started working things out. He did his house arrest while with me, and started working. I never asked anything of him except that he does a fair amount of chores while he is here, and abide by the rules of his probation. Well, he decided that probation wasn't real, and proceeded to purchase alcohol for himself and steal some of my own. According to his probation he isn't supposed to drink. I was out of the house for a few days, and he was supposed to watch over it along with the dogs and cat. This turned into a long stream of arguments that ended up with him being told to go to rehab and curb his alcoholism that he has an issue with. He refused to do so. He then threatened to punch me if I ever talked to him like that again. I told him to get out. He has been sucking off my nipple for 2 months. I guess this brings me to the big question.

He has never paid rent. He tried, but I returned it saying that he needs to use it to pay his phone bill, gas, and his community service as outlined by his probation. He is requesting a written 30 day eviction notice, but I gave him 10 days to leave since he failed to go to rehab. None of this is written record anywhere. Do I have a right to kick him out? Does he have the right the right to stay at my house? If he threatens me again, what actions can I take?",1
"[MN] [USA]Does my Employer owe me overtime?. Hello,

Started a new job recently at a restaurant in a busy neighborhood. Not sure on the specifics  of the restaurants income. I worked 50+ (more like 50.5-52.0 hours) on the first week of my work week. I approached my employer after I got my check and my shift was done and asked if I was owed OT for the week I worked 50 hours. My employer said OT is only required for 80+ hours in a TWO week period. I pointed out I had worked 81.80 hours in my pay period and didn't receive 1.80 hours of OT if that was in fact the case. I also told him all of my previous jobs, which admittedly have been big business/corporate (compared to this family owned business) have paid me OT after 40 hours in one week. He gave me a run around and I pretty much got no where with him.

1). Is this legal in MN? Seems MN law dictates OT can only be applied after 48 hours in a 7day period, which still at MINIMUM (correct if wrong) would me I owuld have 2ish hoours of OT.

2). Federal states ""Employees covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) must receive overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek of at least one and one-half times their regular rates of pay. "" [here](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/overtimepay) if certaing requirements are met. 

AM I getting jipped? Any advice how to handle this? My employer stated he ""would take care of me"" for it but this is the second of three pay checks that seem to have been off. (the second he wrote me a personal check without taking taxes out or not enoug taxes out, I'm not entirely sure)",0
"[TX] Ensuring children go to family friends instead of grandparents in case parents die early. My wife and I have two very young children (both under the age of 2) who are babysat and adored by family friends who are about our age. They love our kids almost as much as we do. We're trying to make plans for the future, including a will, and want the family friends to raise the kids if something happens to us. They have accepted (tears of joy were involved), and we just need to figure out the legal path.

Our own parents are late in their own life stages due to the age at which we chose to have children, with the youngest of our kids' grandparents about 60 years old. We have concerns with the idea of our kids losing their parents, and then potentially having to deal with losing a new set of parents in their teens (or earlier--three of the four grandparents have serious health conditions). Only one, the wife's grandmother, has what might be considered an ongoing relationship, and that's only once or twice a month for 2-3 hours at a time, always with us around.

The problem is that we expect the grandmother and the father's parents to not take this well (that's a relationship issue and not in play for this post) and to fight it legally. We'd like to know what to expect when we select a lawyer to figure out the path, and what is involved in ensuring that there is an opportunity for the grandparents to be in our kids' lives but not have the opportunity to gain custody. This is prep work to make as easy as possible what is going to be, at least in some ways, a very difficult process.",0
"[CA, USA] Security Deposit Question. Our new scumbag landlord withheld $120 of our security deposit for a professional cleaning crew on our move-out. I let her know that we spent hours cleaning and making the apartment spotless, and we have pictures to show it. However, she says that they always hire a professional cleaning crew, even if it's been cleaned by the tenants and won't refund the money.

Furthermore, there are some scratches and wear on the hardwood floor. Long story short, prior to our move in the old landlord tore up the carpet to replace it, and found the hardwood floor that was previously there. When we moved in, this wood floor already had scratches all over and a big scuff in one place. However since the old landlord let us know about it, we didn't think to take pictures and document it. Then came a new landlord who is handling our move out and is charging us $300 for ""repairs to the scratches.""

There was also peeling paint on two doors when we moved in. We told the maintenance person, but never actually had written correspondence with anyone so she's saying there's no record of it, and she's trying to charge us $100 to repaint the doors.

I'm guessing it's going to come down to filing a claim in small claims court, but except for the pictures we took after cleaning the apartment, we don't really have any proof. I asked the new landlord for the receipts for the repairs and she says she'll try to find them.

If we do file a claim, do we do it in the court where she's located? Or can we do it in the new city we moved to?

Thanks for any advice and suggestions!",1
"Bought a gun, got shipped the wrong gun.. I bought a gun online via an auction. The auction's title, picture and description were for the ""middle model"" of this particular gun style. I was shipped the baseline model, and accepted it at my gun store (called an FFL, you must go to one of these to pick up a gun). This store charges $30 to do all the paperwork so that I could receive the gun (such as a background check). This is great, and completely fair. 

When I got home i noticed the gun was not the advertised model. There are very minor differences on the outside of the gun, you would have to break in down and look at the internals to notice the differences. It was like I ordered a V8 mistang, but was shipped a V6, and I had to pay $30 to drive it off the lot. 

The shipping store is willing to pay for the gun to be returned, but is not paying the $30 transfer fee I paid to my local gun store. I asked they do pay for it, because it was their mistake they listed the wrong item. The owner confirmed it was their fault that the advertisement was wrong. 

Im considering canceling the charge, and telling them to come pick up the gun whenever they want (it is a 2 hour drive for them). Unless they decide to pay back that $30 in addition to the price of the gun.  Basically, I lost money because of their mistake. And they expect me to go out of my way to ship a gun back to them, which I have not done and is probably a little tough to do. 

They have also tied up ~$450 of my money due to this. Should I just cancel the charge because I didnt get what I ordered, and make them come get it?",0
"Lawyer won't answer my calls after 'winning' my case. So I hired a lawyer last year to help me with my child support case. Back story, I was a SAHM for three years and also a full time student. Ex and I decided to mutually split and split our times with the kids as well. After the separation, ex was acting childish and stupid so I started getting my evidence together to take him to court to get primary custody of the kids and child support as well. Of course, I had to get state support since I was not working after the separation and they referred me to their 'go to lawyer'. I contacted said lawyer and her paralegal. They assured me it would be an easy case and to send everything their way. 

Long story short, I didn't get primary custody, but shared.  50/50 was what the judge ordered. Even though I had multiple proof of him not being fit to have the children for 50% of the time. Anyways, after the judge ruled the shared custody, we were supposed to go over child support. Here where I'm at, the child support services will not talk to me since I'm being represented by my attorney. They will only speak to her and will only accept documents from her. I've tried calling, emailing and even stopping by the office but they've cut me out cold. 

What can I do? Our contract is different because I was referred to her by the state. I paid a one time fee and she said it would cover ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. Even if I needed her a few years down the line, as long as it was about my case with my ex. I feel like she's trying not to help me since she's technically losing out on money.

"[OH] Employer changed my hourly wage and did not tell me until I picked my check up.. I work for a summer school program where I am supposed to teach art to school aged children. I am paid $15 an hour for this on a biweekly basis. I have been told to purchase art supplies and I would be reimbursed. I did this back at the end of May and after spending $400, I haven't received any reimbursement. When I ask, I am told that I'll get it on my next check which has not happened. During my request, I told them I could not financially pay for another round of art supplies unless I'm reimbursed for the first.

Once those supplies ran out, I stopped doing art projects with the students. Instead, I created stations for the students where they could use existing resources that I didn't have to pay for. I have been doing this for the last three weeks. When I went into work to get my check, the amount was significantly smaller. I went from $15 an hour to $10 an hour. When I spoke to the owner, I was told it was because I have not been doing art projects with students. I responded that I have yet to be reimbursed for my previous supplies despite being told that I would. The owner told me I was making excuses and that if I didn't like it, I could quit but if I did, I would not be reimbursed for my $400 if I didn't give two weeks.

Am I entitled to the original agreed upon rate of pay? Is she able to go back and change my hourly rate without telling me? Can she legally not reimburse me the costs of the art supplies? 

If I knew my hourly rate would have been cut this significantly, I would have quit.",0

He set up a meeting for a few weeks out, then emailed me a few days later saying he was in town, give him a call, and we can meet if I'm available. I called, no answer, left a voice mail, no call back, emailed mentioning the call and that he could call back at any time that suits him, no email back for 3 days so far.

"[FL] Someone stole a bottle of my leftover hydrocodone pills from my medicine cabinet. Realistically, what would my liability be if whoever it is gets caught with them?. I'm in Florida, though this probably pertains to federal law. I had my wisdom teeth extracted early this year and I was prescribed far more hydrocodone than I would conceivably take. I don't care for opioids or the way they make me feel, so I probably never would have taken any more of those pills, and I had just put the bottle in my cabinet and ignored it. Yesterday, I noticed that the bottle was missing. There are only a couple of people I suspect could have taken it. One was a complete stranger who was in the house in order to assist with installing a security system, but another is a close friend of the family. I really do NOT care about the pills, and I don't want to burn any bridges asking questions about (or of) the friend of the family. However, I know that giving my prescription medication to another person can be a serious offense (I think it's a felony), and with the crackdown on opioids, I am concerned that if my pill bottle shows up in someone else's stash, this could come back to bite me if I don't file a police report about the missing pills. I really don't want the hassle and I *really* don't want to cause trouble for anyone else, but I need to know how serious it is that I cover my own butt here. How far would denying that I even realized the pills were gone go? Are police likely to even investigate something this small?

"Is it illegal to add a new fee 7 months into a membership, when this fee was never mention in your agreement?. Hey r/legaladvice, I'm from Miami, Florida and really needed some help. About 7 months ago I started a gym membership at a local gym near me ($24.99 monthly), and about three weeks ago they told me they were going to stop stamping my parking ticket (because you have to pay for parking), (the only free parking around the gym is a park that is about a mile away and every other parking has you pay $1+ per hour while you're there) because you now have to pay a $9 fee extra a month to pay for parking. I went to talk to the store manager and explained to him my situation and he just laughed and said you either pay for parking or you can't park, which I told him was ridiculous as I've not had to pay for parking since I started my membership ( I had started my membership because I had a couple of friends who have been going to the gym for years and have never had to pay for parking). When I contacted support to cancel my membership they told me that each gym handles parking differently and that I would have to pay for parking since they can't cancel my membership because I don't want to pay the parking fee ( they guy who I talked to told me that this new fee was a rule, and you had to follow new rules implemented). Is it illegal to implement this new fee for members without ever mentioning it in their contract and I'm not allowed to cancel my membership without paying the cancellation fee?

"Father of my kids keeps on delaying court date for partial custody indefinitely. He's completely keeping me out of their lives. What can I do??. Hello Reddit , and thank you for taking the time to read my story.

Throwaway my obvious reasons. I have two kids. A daughter who is 8 and a son that is 5.  When I gave birth to the both of them, I was staying with him, because I didn't have a place to stay myself. As time went on, things went South and we ended up not being able to be in a relationship with each other.  Ever since then, I have been trying to get partial custody because I have a place and would like to see my kids. However, they keep on delaying indefinitely,  because the grandfather has a terminal illness and they're in the grieving process currently. Recently, the father officially has passed, may he rest in peace, and now they're requesting even more time. What can I do? Before they were requesting time because he was very ill, and now they're requesting more time because he died. 

The FOMK isn't even letting me see the kids in any shape or form. They're doing whatever they can to keep me out of the kids life and that's completely unfair. I don't even know what school my youngest son goes to because he hides everything regarding them from me.

I have tried to get partial custody. Filed for child support. What can I do Reddit? Is there anything I can do to stop them from delaying indefinitely like they have been?

Also, his aunt is an attorney and is helping them through the process. What can I do Reddit?

"(MO) Mother with Alzheimer's evicted today with no notice after allegedly slapping someone.. My mother was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease at 59, and is now 66.  For the last 3 years she has stayed in an independent living retirement community that didn't necessarily get involved in her day to day life, but generally would let my sisters and I know if she started progressing more quickly, missed meals, etc.

Cut to a few weeks ago, facility contacted my family saying she has started doing some things (nothing violent, just a lot of getting lost, wandering) that will require us to move her and that we should start ""actively looking"" for a new facility, but said there was no large rush and they took our payment for the entirety of this month.  I'll note here that moving any senior into a retirement home with more care requires them take a physical within 30 days of moving and they must have all medical records.  These take a bit of time to get in order.  In short, we felt they were giving us that time.

This morning, my sister receives a call saying that my mother has slapped someone at the facility and they are kicking her out effective immediately.  They told her that because we've already paid through July there is no need to hurry her things out, just her.

I'm out of town for work and the more information I get from my sisters the more pissed I get a this place.  Am I just way out of line with what I think is right vs. what the law is or is there a firm legal footing to protect my mother, sisters and family from one day notice termination and what I see as essentially rent theft?",1
"Apartment garage door opener fell from ceiling onto car. I live in an apartment with a private garage. I’ve lived in the current apartment for 5 years. Yesterday when I parked my car in the garage and pressed the button to close the door when it was about half way down it sounded odd. Once it reached about 90% down I heard a loud noise and it stopped moving and the remote didn’t respond. I crawled under the door to find that the garage door opener had fallen off of the ceiling and on to the top of my car. I didn’t touch it, took plenty of pictures and called the apartment’s emergency number. They sent someone out at 6:30 this morning and they removed the opener from the top of my car and got the door open. There are two dents in the top of my car from the garage door opener hitting in.
 
My question is, who is responsible for the damage to my car? The maintenance person told me that this is something my renters insurance (which they require and I have) needs to cover. But I think renters insurance would be for something like fire and flooding and not a problem with the way the building was constructed. Should I contact my insurance and file a claim with them, or is the owner of the apartment that I rent responsible for the damage? (State is Wisconsin if local laws matter)
 
There was surprisingly no paint damage to the car, just dents. So maybe the cost to fix it could be less than my insurance deductible and it might not be worth going to the insurance. But I want to know if legally I should be the one who pays for the damage to my property caused by their garage door opener.

"[NY] Parking garage gave my car to a stranger and it got damaged. This is in Brooklyn, NY. Last Saturday, 7/1 I picked up my car from a parking garage I rent a space from in Brooklyn. I noticed some body damage that I hadn't seen before, so I filled out a damage report since I believed it was the responsibility of the garage. 

Today I heard back from the owner of the garage. He let me know over the phone that the staff had pointed out the damage to me when the car was returned, so unfortunately it wasn't their responsibility. I didn't remember this happening and while my wife also uses the car, she hadn't told me anything about it,

The owner sent me the security footage to review, but because of the format I wasn't able to at that moment. I promised him I would and then get back to him.

When I reviewed the footage I did see that on June 30 (the day before I reported the damage) the car was in the lot and I see an attendant pointing out the damage to someone. I'm assuming that person is the driver, returning the car to the lot.

The person in the footage isn't me or my wife, the only two people who pick up the car. I never authorized anyone else to pick up the car, nor did my wife. 

The body damage is just cosmetic so it wouldn't be thousands (I don't think) to fix, but it would be at least a few hundred, maybe more. I'm also really anxious about what was done in my car without me knowing and how often this might have happened. I am due to move out of state this Thursday, 7/13, so I'll be severing my relationship with the garage anyway, but I'd appreciate any advice on how best to proceed. Thanks!",0
"I'm sixteen and got a speeding ticket. Any idea what to expect in traffic court. This is my first post to reddit so sorry if I seem a little lost, this just seemed like a good place to get advice. As mentioned in the title, I'm only 16, I live in West Virginia, and I already have a speeding ticket. I was caught going 40 in a 25. The reason behind it seems very generic, but basically I was trying to follow a friends car. We had been split at an intersection and he was barely in my pov so I sped up to try to keep up. Low and behold, a cop was set up right on the street I chose to speed up on. He pulled me over, handed me a ticket, and gave me a court date. I've never been to court and I have no prior moving violations, which is why I'm here. I have zero knowledge as what to expect to happen and what to do. I believe I show up well dressed, sign in, and then wait for my name to be called while waiting in a courtroom. I think I then walk up to a stand, the judge reads off my conviction, and then I give my plea and a reasoning. I'm thinking of saying No Contest as I feel I was speeding, but I'm honestly not sure if I was going as high as 40. To be frank I don't even know what speed I was going, as I was so focused on keeping up with my friend, but generally my car shakes at around 35+. And my car had not been shaking when I got pulled over. So does anyone's know what to do in traffic court? And what should I expect my outcome to be? I'm expecting to lose my license, but as said I have no idea. Also do remember I'm from West Virginia. I do know states have varying laws about this stuff. Thanks for your time!",0
"Non-compete Agreement for a Real Estate Agent (Michigan). Hello everyone,

I am a real estate agent. When I first began my career, I was quite naive and I signed a non-compete agreement because the firm claimed they had a number of trade secrets, incredible training, etc. 

After receiving my first paychecks, I was quite disappointed, and I left for a different brokerage. My old firm's lawyer has now sent me a letter saying that I must stop or they will pursue legal action against me. 

The non compete says that I cannot work for or operate within 25 miles of any of their offices. They have 4 office across the Detroit Metro region. The term is 2 years.

I know I knew what I was signing, but I had no idea it could hinder my career in this manner. A real estate agent's career depends on their sphere of influence and all of my SOi live around me. A 25 mile non compete puts me out of business for 2 years. I have to drive at least an hour and half to get to a firm outside this region. Furthermore, after interviewing with a number of firms, I have found that there really aren't any trade secrets in Real Estate. And many other firms have more robust training regimes with better splits, and every single one of them did not require a such a noncompete to be signed. 

I called my state real estate legal hotline and the lawyer had no idea what to do because he had never hear of non compete agreements in our industry. Ditto with the executive officer of my board. They had never heard of such a thing in my field. 

I am not sure what to do. 

I can send a copy of that agreement and the letter they send me on request.",0
"Can I tell my neighbor that I have video footage of him acting like a lunatic. This happened months ago and the hoop is still sitting there, the guy has city ties and is running for common council. I couldn't care less about It but now I have a bee in my bonnet about messing with him. 

My neighbor has an illegal basketball hoop on our shared street. Where we live they are illegal and the city makes you remove them. It happened to my cousin. A city official came to my next door neighbors house asking who the hoop belonged to, and she told him it was the mans hoop. The man found out because he is in some political position. He is currently running for common council I believe is the position. He has connections to the city. He stormed into the street and started screaming ""FUCKKK YOUUUU (NEIGHBORS NAME)!!!!!!!!!!! FUCKKKK YOUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" He did this multiple times until we went over to our neighbor and told her what was going on. Someone had called the city about his hoop and he thought it was her. It was not. My one regret is not getting it on video. The guy is a real jerk and the worst neighbor we've ever had. He is rude and disrespectful and has a very short temper. We don't care about the hoop, it was the city who came to ask about it. We didn't ask for it to be removed but now after what he has done I want to get it removed. He has city ties so I'm sure it will be hard. 

My question is, can I send him a letter telling him I have video of him acting like a fool. I obviously don't but I want to mess with him. Just for shits and giggles. And what can I do about the hoop. This guy is a real dirt bag.",0
"Violence in the workplace, and threat of being fired. Need some advice.. A few weeks ago a co-worker of mine (I am a supervisor) got into a yelling match with me over me asking him to do something he didn't want to do. He did not directly threaten me verbally at this point, but he is twice my size and was attempting to intimidate me; including him coming up close to me and asking ""You wanna say something to me?"" In a threatening tone. 
I contacted our director, and the other supervisor, to alert them to this. The other supervisor comes in because they live close and I was very much under the impression I was not safe at work. The co-worker that threatened me returned; thinking I was out of the office, he began to brag about how he was about to come back in and attack me. 

At this, I ask him to leave for the day and all hell breaks loose. He and the other supervisor start screaming at one another, as myself and other had to hold the two back from one another or there would have been a fight. Finally he leaves the office, and having heard what happened, our director comes in to speak with him. Our director leaves, the asshole who threatened me got to work the rest of the shift. I was promised that the situation would be resolved and I was more than happy to be patient. Weeks have passed and literally nothing has been done, even the bare minimum that the director promised. 

Now when have HR coming in tomorrow with an eye to fire all three of us involved. I'm at my ropes end with this company, and I've been told by a few people that if I'm fired that I'd be in my right to sue them. Is there any truth to that?",0
"I am now over 21 but am concerned about my REAL ID being seized as a fake. How likely is this and what should I do if this occurs?. I from the United States and split my time between California and Arizona. I recently stopped in a gas station to buy a beer on the way home and was asked to present my ID. 

I gave the clerk my military ID and he said the birth date appeared to be 1998, not 1996 and accused me of trying to buy underage. I offered him my license and he seemed skeptical that it was real. I assured him it was, to which he said ""if that's your story and you're sticking to it,"" and let me finish my transaction and leave. 

I was at a liquor store with my father earlier this weekend and got carded with him because I had been carrying the alcohol to the register. A manager had to verify my ID's authenticity (I used my state driver's license to avoid the confusion caused my my military ID) and they asked my dad (not me) the DOB on my ID to ensure it is legitimate. They then wrote my information down at the register. 

While neither of these incidents resulted in any kind of actual legal trouble I'm concerned that my real ID (specifically my military ID) will be seized or the police will become involved. I have been told my real Arizona driver's license looks incredibly fake since it is a vertical ID and an older design. That will be fixed after I go to motor vehicles tomorrow.

TL;DR I have more ham one form of legal ID on me and I am of age to drink. I've had several people skeptical of my IDs' legitimacy and worry about the consequences if I'm falsely accused of having a fake ID and/or it being seized.",0
"MD. Job Suspension for a Server. Hey guys,

I've been serving at a restaurant for a little over 4-5 months. A few weeks ago I was appearing on the schedule less often, and recently, the schedule was sent out and I wasn't on it at ALL. I hadn't been informed of anything, or talked to by anyone about this happening, but since there has been some tension at work regarding myself and other employees, I wondered if I had gotten fired. 

So, naturally, I brought it up in the group chat that our coworkers and managers use to communicate with each other, asking if I was fired. My manager texted me, saying they *needed to investigate something regarding my past behavior, and before they got any conclusion I was suspended.* I asked him *what past behavior*, he said he *didn't know, and needed to talk to a few people first.* Furthermore, *there was no conclusion, and they may never get a solid conclusion.* So I asked him *why am I being suspended if he doesn't know what he's suspending me for*, he responded saying *you should ask yourself what happened, that (I) had said something to a coworker about something which was against the interest and honesty of the restaurant, there was no conclusion, and he was going to talk to a few people then talk to me.*

I was so confused, I know that there is no law requirement saying you have to tell someone why you're firing them, but he didn't say I was fired, he said I was suspended. 

It has been over 2 weeks since he told me this, and has still not gotten back to me, nor has he put me on the schedule as I'm still part of the chat and see it every week. 

Is there anything I can do?",0
"How to change public defenders in WA state?. I am in Oregon, sister in trouble is in WA. Her public defender is terrible. Our family is kind of shitty, and I have no money for an attorney. She has been waiting for trial for a very complicated case for 2 years. Her court-appointed attorney has ignored all of the resources and advocate options as well as contact info for expert witnesses I have provided. He has condescended to me, yelled at me over the phone. I told him that I will only communicate with him via email.

He has been often rude and aggressive toward her, then seems to have compassion on their next visit. He has told me to send the information and contact info of the people I have spoken to, they have tried to contact him, and no response. I wrote to him and told him she felt bullied and disregarded. He seemed to be on her side for about a month, then back to the roller coaster approach.

She said she has written a letter to the judge and told me it had been ignored. I have so few details, her self-worth is shattered, she has lost her fight. She told her psych doctor she wanted a new attorney and she was condescending and dismissive.

I have contacted another public defender in WA because I think she can switch easily if someone else is willing to step in? That person did not contact me back, and I don’t want to continue barking up the wrong tree. I also am afraid that the next one might be worse.

What might my best strategy be? We have contacted all of the legal aid resources we could find, and have gotten very minimal response.

"Wisconsin; I messed up at commissioner court in a civil case. Help??. Hello all!  

A little background: 

I purchased a key from a dealership which was sold 2 days after my purchase. The key caused damage to my vehicle ($600 worth).   
  
I attempted to reach out to [who I believed the previous] owner was for reimbursement(I contacted their 2nd dealership); was told no at first; then given an offer of full reimbursement for my damages that was rescinded after filing a consumer complaint against the LLC. 
  
I sued the LLC that owned the dealership I contacted for repairs (they were the previous mgmt/owners).   
  
At commissioners court, the LLCs' attorney told me that I sued the wrong people; claiming instead of the LLC I should have sued an Inc  that supposedly ran the business. [which was apparently defunct, thus uncollectible] but she did not have the paperwork to prove it, saying she'd be better prepared and would submit it if I did take it to court.   
  
I accepted an offer way too below what I was seeking to be done because I was stressed out and wasn't prepared for this curveball.   

  
I'd like to file a motion to reopen but I'm unsure if I'm allowed to. 

The reason I want to reopen is that I found evidence of the LLC (doing business as) the dealership which I bought the Key from, filed with the city they are located in.   
  
Note: the registered agent of the [maybe defunct] inc., and the LLC are the same with the same office too. 



Do I have anything? I really do not know how to condense this, but I will clarify if needed. I really appreciate any time you all take to read though this.. thank you!!",0
"[VA] malpractice due to injury during surgery? Or lack of action afterwards ?. I want to note that the hospital is in VA and we are living in NC.. don't know if that makes a difference. 

My father had a procedure to remove kidney due to cancer. When they got in there they found his kidney was stuck to his small intestines, turning a 4-5 hour surgery into an 8-9 hour surgery.  

Upon waking up my fathers only complaint was hip pain and he complained through the night. They said it was due to laying on that hip so long, because he's a big guy. Next morning the doctor comes in and he complains to doctor that did testing and found that his muscle in the hip/rear was dead /dying.. similar to a crush injury. From lying on it so long. They rolled him into surgery and removed a large chunk. Later that week they removed more . 

This muscle dying released proteins or toxins that damaged his other *only* kidney and he is now on dialysis, and we are hoping for a good recovery 

At this time we are not sure of the long term effects on his mobility etc from losing so much muscle in his rear. We also do not know if the kidney damage is permanent. 

We feel that the positioning during surgery should have been evaluated when they realized it was going to be a far longer surgery and the inaction of the care providers after he complained about major hip pain should have raised red flags and been attended to sooner thus preventing so much proteins and toxins from damaging his kidney so bad. 

Please excuse my lack of medical jargon and let me know if you need any more details to give me an idea if we have something to pursue here .",0
"[MA] Personal Injury Lawyers - ""Discovery of Harm""? Or - Help with disability claim?. Almost 20 years ago, an extremely fucked up series of events happened to me in public schools. I'd be willing to discuss more details in a private message or an e-mail, but here's the brief sequence of events:    
    
1.) A school administrator assaulted me in his office (grabbed me by the throat and slammed me against the wall, didn't stop choking me until another teacher who was present physically removed him)    
2.) Another student pulled a stupid prank and blew up a toilet. I happened to be in the bathroom at the same time. Charges were pressed against both of us, and we were both suspended indefinitely. I spent almost 2 years awaiting trial. The trial lasted 15 minutes. The judge grilled the DA for wasting everyone's time.    
3.) Started going to school in the next town over. Was brutally beaten by a student, perhaps as a ""hazing"" ritual - I had never seen him before.    
4.) Dropped out of school and started using. Spent the rest of my life as a high functioning addict - until 16 months ago.    
5.) Got sober, subsequently had a serious mental break down, was hospitalized, diagnosed with several severe mental illnesses.    
    
Not sure if there's any lawsuit here. It's all super fucked up but it was also so long ago. If that idea is dead in the water, what can I do about the fact that I keep getting denied when I put in disability claims?

"Invoiced for $1000 dollars 2 months after we moved out pf our appartment for stains on the carpet.. Today my SO recieved an email from our previous appartment company stating that we owe $1000 for stains on the carpet. We moved out before May 1st and did not recieve this invoice till today. It said we have till August 30 to pay or it will be going to collections.

Over the past year or so my health and my SO had been failing. After many docters visits we still could not figure out what was wrong with us. So in march we had a mould test done and it tested possitive for an elevated levels of mould in the appartement. We informed our property managers about this and they came in and cut up the walls looking for mould. They were unable to identity were it was coming from. We requested to move out asap. They told us that was not enough notice but since health was an issue they would allow us to move out before may 1st and they would use our last months rent for april. We moved out the weekend before the first. When I returned the keys there was no mention of a move out inspection and they had previously told us not to worry about steam cleaning the carpets since there were several holes in wall (made by them looking for mould) and they would need to be drywalled. The carpets were not stained beyond the normal wear and tear and after getting some quotes from steaming companies the average cost to have a 2 bedroom apartment cleaned in my area is between $200-350. 

$1000 seems insane to me and this feels like extortion. Is there anyway to fight this? 

Both my SO and my health have improved since moving out of the appartment.",1
"Slipped and fell at walmart due to a pipe they failed to fix that was leaking. Do I have a case?. Was at walmart last night and was walking up the frozen food isle to start heading to check out. Right as I reached the end of the isle I slipped smacked the side of my face along my jaw against the freezer door, landed on my butt and hit my left elbow, ankle and tailbone. Along with catching my toe on one of those end racks. Thankfully a friend was with me and helped me up. The back of my pants were soaked. Sure enough I slipped in a puddle of water. Now it had been raining, so I grabbed the first employee I saw and let them know I was injured and there was water on the floor. He spoke no English and didnt understand I needed a manager. I had to almost drag him to where I fell to even get him to pay attention. He still didn't call a manager. Went to customer service and they were gonna make me wait. So we went to jewelry where someone finally called a manager. Waited 10 min before they came up. She handed me an incident report and asked where it occurred. I told her the location and her reply was ""we have busted pipes up there that leak and need to be fixed"" and I was not the first injury. So they know there's a leak, and have neglected to fix it or put up a sign. I currently have no insurance but my jawline to my temple is killing me, my elbow hurts and it feels like I tore something in my left shoulder.

"I was in a motorcycle accident, I'm not sure what to do.(Fontana, CA). This happened on Wednesday, I'm pretty much not injured, my motorcycle hasn't been towed to the shop yet, I don't know the damage figures (I just hope it won't be totaled, my dumbass 23 year old self didn't get GAP insurance)

According to Russ Brown (or at least someone from them) since I wasn't majorly injured, there's nothing they can really help me with. I haven't received a copy of the collision report by the police, either. 

As for the accident itself, I was riding down the freeway, going about 20mph between lanes (HOV and fast lane) when a Toyota Camry that I was either about to pass or already passing, turned into the next lane(one of those, gotta get in that lane, theres space, quick turns without looking) and hit me, I went down. I only remember the impact, then rolling. Then 2 gracious men, helped me get from the middle of the freeway to the far right side, along with my bike. After they checked if I was ok of course, they also called the ambulance for me.  

I did not rear end the Camry, all the damage is right behind her passenger side rear tire. 

I'm just afraid I won't be able to get my motorcycle back, that motorcycle is all I really own and I don't know what to do. 

I won't be able to go to work until it's fixed, Interviews are iffy, I'd have to borrow my parents truck but it's a salvaged truck that isn't working right a lot of the time. I commute from Fontana to LA, uber would be too expensive. Plus because of this I missed out on the last two days of my contract with an agency.

"[TX] Friend just got notice to vacate her rented house at the end of the month. What can she do?. My friend has been renting a house for several years. She is always on time with her rent and has kept the property in good repair. She received an email today saying that the landlord wants her out by the end of the month. No reason was given. She had apparently received a previous email on June 29 notifying her of the landlord's decision, but she didn't see that email in her inbox. So technically she's been given a month's notice, but for all practical purposes, she's looking at losing her home in about two weeks.

Relevant/possibly relevant info:

- She's in Texas.

- She's pretty sure she wasn't sent a new lease agreement for this year (I'm not sure when her lease year was up). If she's right, she doesn't have the protection of a lease.

- She has a 14 year old daughter and 19 year old son living with her. Obviously the 19yo is an adult, but does the fact that a minor is involved affect anything?

- She works for a company, but from her home. She says that it takes more than two weeks to get the company to move her equipment to a new location, and she isn't allowed to move the equipment herself.

- She has never received a mailed notice, just email.

Does she have any options here? Is this eviction legal, especially in that short a time frame? 

She could potentially move somewhere else, but not in the time frame she's looking at. She may not even be able to get her work equipment out of the house in that amount of time. Does she have any options for fighting the eviction or at least buying some time to find a new place and move?",1

"(CA) Boss is changing time off after vacation. I have worked for this company since 2009. In 2015 I left for 8 months and when they asked me to come back we negotiated terms. As part of this deal I was now a salaried employee and working mon-Thursday. All was well and fine so I thought. Two months ago I put in a ""time off request"" for 8 working days in late June. The request was accepted and signed by the owner who is my direct boss. And nothing more was said. A week after I got back my boss told me that because I was gone so long I had to ""make up"" days I missed. This bothered me because he never mentioned it before I left or before he signed and agreed. It was only after I was back and he ""realized"" how long I would be gone. That's his fault. So he said I had to make up the days I was gone. He said he would pay me for 40 hours but the rest was on me to make up. I was bothered by it but ok whatever I'll work a Friday or two that's fine. 


But then I got an email sunday asking me to fill out a new time sheet for the time I was gone and submit a plan in writing to him to make up the days I missed. Also He wants me to go through all my time sheets since I came back and document any other days he approved for vacation and document those on time sheets and show what days I will make up as well. 


Then he is telling me that he is going to give me different vacation allotment because I work 4 days a week (32 total vacation hours per year when everyone else gets 40 hours no matter what) because I am salaried. 

So do I have any room to say to him that I am not going to make up time because he did not require me to until after the fact?",0
"(NJ, USA) [tenant] information needed on verbal lease agreement. In May 2016 I signed a one year lease for a place. In late-February/early-March of 2017 my landlord asked me if I'd be renewing my lease, I respond with ""as of right now yes"". Come May 2017, there was no signing of a new lease for May 2017-2018. I was informed (or misinformed) that when a written year lease is up and a new lease for the next year isn't signed it goes to a month-to-month lease.

"Sewage company flooded my house with sewage. Happened in Missouri this week.  A company that seems to be contracted by the city was working on a line next to my house.  There was a surge of wastewater while they had the line blocked(my vague understanding of the situation) and it caused the waste to back up into my house, completely covering the downstairs floor in sludge that I assume to be mostly human waste.  I woke up sometime within the next 3 hours to find this;  went outside and got ahold of the sewage company workers who were still working outside and let them know about it, they contacted their supervisor who came to my house, took pictures, called his boss and then told me that they were taking responsibility for the  incident.

So far they've hired a company to do the cleanup, and the same company is expected to start doing the repairs(floors, carpet, drywall, etc) Monday.  They've also agreed to get the HVAC ducts cleaned out because the AC is currently circulating the smell of sewage through the house even after the cleanup downstairs.

"[FL] Mom[52] has serious health issues and got denied disability twice. She has a pacemaker, and is a 3 time cancer survivor in her mid 20s. She has been in and out of the hospital every month for the past few years. First it was heart issues, and another was breathing problems. She got many heart surgeries, including heart valve and stents. She has had heart attacks too. She barely has any muscle on the back of her neck, so its hard on her to look up while at work.

I almost lost my mom many times. I'm 20, she is 52. All of these problems are from the radiation she endured in her twenties. Recently, she was hospitalized for over a month because she couldn't breath. She had fluid drained out of her lungs, which was a major surgery. She made it through it, and now has to use an oxygen machine at home and oxygen tanks every where she goes. 

We struggle financially, and as a college student that works almost 40 hours a week, half of my paycheck goes to bills. She has applied for disability twice, and has been denied twice. I'm in shock, especially because of everything she has been through. And now that she relys on oxygen tanks, it makes me feel horrible she has to still work because she got denied. We did get a lawyer, but it could take up to 2 years now. 

Is there any way to fast track this process? Or any place we can appeal this? There is absolutely no reason she should have been denied. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm a Florida resident if that helps.

Edit: we were also denied food stamps, even though we can barely afford food and barely get by with bills. She has lost too much weight since she has been on the oxygen machine.",0
"Losing green card for non-residency. Hey guys, first time posting so here goes...

Backstory: My family has permanent residency status for the US from Canada, and everybody minus my dad have moved here and lived here for at least 2 years. My dad had to stay back because of delays in my brother's approval process, and after it was finally approved, he still resides in Canada due to our property not selling. He has visited the US frequently, but never stayed longer than a month.

The current situation: Dad's mother was in a coma, and her condition is deteriorating, so he intends to visit her overseas, then visit us before going back to Canada. Before leaving Canada, he was stopped by immigration and they interviewed him because he has never remained in the US since green card was approved 3+ years ago, apparently not following the rules. They said they were notating the account, and though they cannot take away the green card, they could send him to court to appeal. He took the flight, but they said he is taking a risk, and the US airport might withold the card or prevent him from flying. His cousin (immigration attorney) said he could fill out a travel request application, but it could take 6 weeks.

He's in the NY airport currently, and likely will continue to fly overseas to visit his mother, but that may jeopardize the permanent residency process my parents have spent so many years and money working on. Is this a possibility, and what can we do to minimize the risk?

Any thoughts?

In his will he left his belongings to his new wife, while my mother got all the money. At the time of his passing he had a truck and a motorcycle, and my mom had to pay off the rest of the bike with the money she got. His wife never wanted the bike and said I could keep it. And I reallllyyy want it just because he was my only sibling and we were really close and she won't ever let me have his truck. Soon after agreeing to let me have it she decided she was going to make us buy it. So again my mother paid for the bike. My sister in law signed the title and we got the bike. When I tried to take the title to the DMV they said it wouldn't work because the title is still in my brothers name. I gave them my brothers death certifacte as well as his marriage license to try to show them she was the only one who was able to sign it. They said I couldn't do it because she would have to go to the DMV and switch the title to her name, then sign that one. Now she won't do it, because she's evil (she doesn't even let us see my nephew without a court order). So I have his bike and it's in great condition but I can't register it because she won't take the time to go to the DMV and switch it even if we pay the fee. My mom says she can't afford a lawyer but I honestly don't think she's looked at all. Is there anything I can do? My mom simply won't put in the effort, I think she thinks I'll wreck or something, I don't know. I just know I really want that bike to serve it's purpose and not just rot away in a garage. Please help me Reddit.",0
"Unfit mother with section 8... Is this transferable??. Hey everyone. I'm in a bit of a predicament and I'm not sure how to proceed. My mother is seriously mentally ill and has been refusing treatment for as long as I can remember. I beg her to get help because at this point she's extremely paranoid, terrified of touching things (germ situation), repeats herself 100x times, and has pulled out all her hair, and sadly, there's even more :( I've tried pretty much everything, but she's ALWAYS been this way. It even had a huge effect on my upbringing and due to that I have CPTSD. She once tried to burn me alive as an infant, and would regularly slam my head into concrete and the tub for things as simple as knocking over my juicebox. I'm afraid that at the rate she's going, she's just going to crash and burn... hard. I have a 16 year old sister too, and I fear that if my mom really gets out of hand, we'll be evicted. She honestly screams 24/7 so I'm not even sure how we haven't gotten kicked out. Due to my cptsd and a slew of other conditions, I'm disabled and can only work a job from home, but that's not enough for me to move my sister and myself out... I was wondering if there was any way the section 8 could be transferred to me or my sister, as my mother isn't stable or responsible enough for this kind of thing and always submits their paperwork MONTHS late. It's like she's trying to go out of her way to get us kicked out. Anyway, I'd like to keep my little sister safe, more importantly. Is there any way we could protect ourselves and our housing as my mother continues to self destruct ?? 
Thank you, and sorry for the essay... It's just been a LOT :/",1
"Vacating home due to mice, what are my rights?. Hi All,
We (Family of 4) are currently living in Boston and leasing a property. It is an old brownstone multi-story with different tenants on each floor. We are very clean people who occupy the bottom two floors.  We recently (after 6 months or so) began to notice pest droppings on the floor, it turns out it is from mice. New people moved in upstairs recently and we think the mice probably got into the building during the process. We informed the landlord immediately and sent pictures etc. and he came and set some traps, but suggested there was no point in an exterminator (""they only set traps too""). Every day since we are finding mice droppings in the home. There are gnaw marks on the floorboard by the wall, we noticed lots of holes in the old bricks on the wall, and they are able to travel up through the floorboards from inside the cavity behind the wall downstairs. Generally there are holes in a lot of places, and we have been trying to plug them up with steel wool etc. We have young two kids (1 &amp; 2 y.o.) and are fearful of one of them picking up droppings or a mouse entering their room/crib and biting them or carrying disease. Essentially we want to vacate the property asap, we don't feel safe and are uncomfortable eating or sleeping here. I have already killed one mouse but have also seen more. Our rent is around $3000 a month and we are unsure of whether we can claim back any of the rent we have paid out once we vacate. Our lease is up on 9/1 and has already been paid until then. Do we just walk away, could we claim back some of the 4500 or so we have paid? Any advice would be appreciated.",1
"I (US) Purchased a pair of boots from Saint Laurent in(EU) last year, I'm entitled to VAT Tax refund, company won't refund. How can I get it back?. Last year while I was visiting Paris, I purchase a rather expensive pair of boots I had been saving up months for. I figured I'd buy them in Europe since it's cheaper there ($1036) instead of $1293 in USA. I was told by the salesperson that I would receive a VAT tax refund at the airport after filling out several forms at the shop that I would just have to see customs and get my tax (about $120)refunded to me there. 
I got to the airport, waited in a long line, almost missing my flight and the agents told me that I didn't have the correct form. 
When getting home, I emailed the boutique explaining that I was unable to receive my money.
 The sales person offered to speak to me via WhatsApp and gave me instructions how I could go to my local French Consulate and pay a 35 Euro fee to file the VAT tax return form to EU Customs located in Ireland. I gathered all the documents and made multiple trips to the consulate since each time I kept forgetting the appropriate documents. I mailed everything out, waited about 3-4 weeks and received no update. It's been about 8 months since then and I still have not received my money, even after emailing them several times and having them tell me that they'd look into this. 

I know it's only $120 but I paid $35 and the sales associate said that the company would refund me for the fee and I went through all that trouble and they promised I would get it. I am visiting paris next month so I thought I could speak to their sales manager, but what can I do at this point?

"[Ontario] A woman who dined at our resraurant is going to the newspaper over food poisoning claims, which she has no concrete evidence for.. My partner co-owns a popular restaurant in our city, and I tend to deal with the general complaints and inquiries that we recieve. 

Recently, a woman contacted us over Facebook complaining that she and her friends got food poisoning from our restaurant. [Here's an album of our conversation.](https://imgur.com/a/1OIvv) 

In order to prove food poisoning, you must first provide evidence that the food you ate was contaminated, and that this contamination caused you to fall ill. Typically a customer would call their local health committee in order to have an inspection done, which she hasn't. We issued an inspection ourselves, regardless of always having an incredibly clean restaurant with quality produce and staff. We've always passed our inspections.

I actually used to work at the newspaper company she said she talked to, so I contacted the director of the newsroom to confirm that she was in touch with them. The director has yet to get back to me, but I find it odd that a customer would contact the media prior to contacting the restaurant itself. It feels threatening from our end. 

I should note that neither of our servers from that afternoon remember ever seeing her, but we can't rely on their memory. I also eat at our restaurant often and have never felt sick afterwards.

Is there anything we can do about this lady?

**TL;DR: A woman contacted us over Facebook to say we gave her and her friends food poisoning. We've never received claims like this before, and our restaurant consistently passes health inspections.",0
"Internal possession of alcohol help (New Hampshire). When I was 17 or so I got an internal possession of alcohol violation, came with a $344 fine. Then when I was 19, i was just chilling with a few buddies at a small fire drinking a few beers and cops showed up for I have no idea why. Well I got a  second internal possession charge (after admitting to drinking which I should've avoided I now know but too late for that). That came with a $750 fine and a license suspension of 2 months. The event wasn't driving related whatsoever but I guess that's just how NH rolls, pretty unfortunate, lost my delivery driving job. Anyways, I'm 23 now turning 24 and it's still affecting me in slight ways. Two years ago worked for a company and would have been able to drive one of the trucks (making a few more bucks an hour) until the company found out it'd jack up their insurance having me on it, because of these unrelated to driving charges. My then boss was very skeptical because he thought I had been drinking and driving and said I should've been straight up with him until I cleared it up and told him the story. Anyways, couldn't drive there. Then this summer, i got a job landscaping and AGAIN am not able to be put on to my bosses insurance because it would jack his insurance up leading to me not being able to drive any of his company trucks. I for one think it's completely unfair that these nondriving related charges can affect me so much, but that's beside the point. Getting to the point, are these violations ever going to go away or stop affecting me? The officer who I argued with about my second violation said it would in no way affect me and all I'd get was a fine.",0
"Wife's union sent her a letter indicating she (and some other employees) owe back payments.. Long story short: Wife works as an RN in California. She hasn't been getting union dues deducted from her paychecks for quite some time (something I've been on her about checking in with, but I guess she/we are just too busy to rectify the problem.. we do acknowledge that unions are important and thought she just wasn't signed on with hers, not that she wasn't paying the dues). 

Nowhere on her paychecks since roughly 2014 has there been a union dues deduction. Recently, she has received a letter from her union stating that they have experienced ""phenomenal growth"" in recent years and that some employees have fallen through the cracks of their antiquated system, thus deductions had stopped for some employees. 

With their updated database they've discovered that some people owe money, and we're being told that she now owes more than a thousand dollars in back payments just because this union decided to upgrade a system and discovered they fucked up and weren't deducting people properly. 

The document is basically admitting fault here. I called the union myself and discovered that it's basically a mandatory repayment (of course they are going to say that), but that there's ""no due date""... they just want to set up a payment plan.  The rep did say, however, that collections could be involved at a later time if no payments are arranged. 

What are my options?  It just seems like an odd move for a union to go about correcting their huge mistake like this.. my wife wants to just blindly pay the amount, but I am extremely hesitant. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",0
"Legal rights biological father Florida. My ex wife's boyfriend is over stepping his bounds taking over my role as a father of my 7 year old son. We divorced when my son was 3 and ex wife garnered the relationship right then and they have been living together for over two years. Immediately, my ex wife and boyfriend established solid boundaries that keeps boyfriend out of the father like role, as I am heavily involved in my son's life. Ex-wife has been extremely reasonable with me and almost have had all weekends with my son. The problem now is that although she is taking some of that time back, which is in her legal right... She isn't necessarily making that time to be entirely with our son, instead the time is bring channeled over to the boyfriend to spend time with our son on full day excursions etc., and she doesn't care or mind it. I prefer she spends most of the time with him not the other way around.

The relationship between the mother and boyfriend is unusual, and it seems as if the relationship has more weight on the boyfriend and son side. This is because of several factors:

- ex wife did not have a romantic interest in the new boyfriend, more of a convenience relationship during divorce
- ex wife has no interest in doing meneal chores for child, such as taking and bringing from school, and other school related activities. Are just some examples

Online searches are coming up short for information about my rights as biological father in the state of Florida. Although, from a high level I'm finding that the mothers boyfriend has zero rights to my child.

Can anyone point to a source where I can find out more law info? ....under these circumstances.",0
"[WA] Doing unpaid work on regular basis. I work as a supervisor in a fast food restaurant that is locally owned in eastern Washington. Most of my shifts are closing shifts (75% or so), and where I work, closing shifts are on the clock until a certain time at night, whether all the work is completed or not. Not finishing the work in time (this happens often if we're busy towards the end of the night) does not remove the expectation for the work to get done properly, despite the fact that my fellow closer and I are no longer getting paid. Sometimes this means an extra 5-10 minutes of work, but in our busy season, it very often means 20-30 minutes or more of unpaid work. I'm quite sick of working for free and then getting chewed out if the tiniest thing isn't completed, because I've gotten to the point where once I'm not being paid I stop caring.

Under the FLSA, I've recently learned that I can request up to three years of backpay for unpaid work, but I'm not certain at all how I would go about proving that I've been worked off-the-clock, especially as heavily as I have been (between July 3rd and July 10th, 2017, I easily did at least three hours of unpaid work). My restaurant does have a CCTV security system that my boss taught me how to use and get footage from one time when we were robbed on a shift I was leading, but due to a shortage of hard drive space, all footage older than three days or so is overwritten. Can I get some footage over time of myself and my coworker(s) doing this extra work and use it as legal proof? There's no official tracking of how much work any of us employees have done for free, so if I can't use the security footage, what can I do?",0
"[TX] Victim of a road rage assault- where to go from here?. I was involved in a road rage incident in which someone fired shots directly at my vehicle as I was driving down the road- one of the rounds hit my car, less than a foot away from me. The perpetrator was arrested immediately and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. It is a cut and clear case and I believe that this person will be convicted.

I am far from what you would call a proponent of pursuing damages in court, but I believe this individual intended to harm me (or worse). I was extremely shaken up directly after everything happened, but went on about my business as usual after providing my statement to the police, etc. It scared the hell out of me, naturally, but I never expected to have any further problems. Unfortunately, ever since the incident occurred, I have had persistent nightmares and experience panic attacks almost daily. I have missed nearly two weeks of work. I think most people would consider me to be a fairly realistic and level-headed person, but there have been times where I've been afraid to even leave my house due to the admittedly paranoid misapprehension of my assailant stalking me with the intention of harming me. I get anxious every time I see the same kind of vehicle the assailant was driving or if I hear a car backfire, etc.

Basically, I am dealing with quite a lot of unexpected mental woes stemming from an event that was more traumatic than I initially realized. I've given this a lot of thought and I have yet to come to a final decision, but I'd like to know what steps I should take in the event that I do elect to take legal action against my assailant.",0
"My university screwed me over. I was set to graduate from college within the prescribed 4 years. The final classes I needed to graduate were not offered at my university (small liberal arts college). I missed out on registering for the classes at another school so my time in school was to be extended by a semester. The financial aid office and business offices at my school are terrible. They took forever to get back to me and since I was over 21 they requested dependent verification paperwork. This all took place halfway through the final semester. I had filled out all requirements on my part to receive my financial aid. The only thing I needed to submit was my mother’s tax return forms. Well since I had not graduated on time my mother was upset and kicked me out of her house. So there I was in school, homeless and broke so I stopped attending classes. 

Now I am 10,000 in debt outside of student loans with the school. My concern is how is this possible if I never approved my financial aid (loans). The fault lies in the bad timing on the school’s part. It takes them far too long to communicate with students. Is there anything I can do? I am in too much debit to ignore this and not get a degree. Especially considering the quality of education at the school is a joke and everybody cheats. 

I don’t want to come off as vindictive but my attempts at speaking to the administration have not yielded any results. What can I do to make them listen? Will contacting the accreditation bureau help? I want to include legal action but so far that is a hollow threat with the condition of my finances.

2. My multi-billion dollars employer refused to honor my promotion. Reason? Change of manager and I took FMLA recently. Lol. Not even making this up.
3. Short term renter partied in my property and violated the fire/over occupancy code. Threatening to kill then mellowing down to sue after I kicked him out.
4. Fell of a HD rental truck and tore my ACL (ER, bone bruises, etc). The back cover can't support the steps properly and the employee who rent it out knew it. Guess whos the one who got to load/unload tools.. 
5. Mortgage company who refused to honor the locked rate, ran credit over 12 times in a span of 2 weeks, then offer higher interest because the score went down dramatically. The same company sent the copies of credit request and show they're the only one who request it.

"[FL] Is there any reason to insist on a written agreement as a tenant, if my landlord doesn't seem worried about it?. I'm a college student. On Aug 1, I will be moving into the spare bedroom of a home owned (and occupied) by a woman whose ad I responded to on Craigslist. 

When I asked her about a lease, she said she typically doesn't use them, has been renting her spare rooms to students for the past ten years without issue, and has 'always trusted her gut'. She also mentioned something about it impacting a homestead tax exemption, which might not necessarily be legal but also isn't my concern. Our agreement (verbal, not written) is that I'll pay a set rate every month and that, if I want to move out, I just need to give two months' notice - no security deposits, no first/last. 

Being someone who would rather not commit to something like a 12-month lease at the moment anyhow, I was happy to hear this (and yes, I am assuming that that two months' notice thing goes both ways, and am OK with it). Now, though, I'm wondering whether I should insist on at least a written agreement of some kind. 

On one hand, this woman OOZES levelheadedness and hasn't put up any red flags for me whatsoever - plus, I would imagine she has more to lose than I do from not having a lease. And on the other hand - well, you can never tell with people.

Am I potentially getting myself into trouble here? Is a rental agreement still valid if it's not in writing? What rights, if any, am I giving up by not having a written agreement? 

Thanks for any input, folks.

"[TX]Being harassed by girl I'm seeing's exgirlfriend. He has put salt into my gas tank but I also have a class B misdemeanor warrant out and am afraid of reporting the crime. Help?. I hooked up with a girl in a relationship and her ex-boyfriend has been stalking and harassing her and I separately, always appearing at places he thinks we will show up.  He has had multiple minor unprovoked physical altercations with her involving lots of yelling in public places with multiple witnesses.  

Today I just discovered he has entirely filled my gas tank with salt, which can destroy my car.  He told her over the phone that he had already did this a couple weeks ago but had not actually done it at that point...  I saw him at a local concert last night and I think it set him off, because I looked in my gas tank today and it is completely full of salt.

I would report the crime immediately, but I am in Denton texas and have a warrant out for my arrest in Austin for a class B misdemeanor.  I am afraid they will also take me to jail, but I am a student and taking summer classes.  Will they take me in for my warrant?  Is this sufficient evidence to have him convicted?  Are the other altercations enough to file a restraining order?  Neither her nor I feel safe in this town anymore because of the things he has been doing.  I am an extremely poor student and in dire need of help so any advice is much appreciated.

My tentative plan is to go through all of my classes tomorrow and report the crime regardless of if they arrest me for my warrant or not... but at least I will not miss class, as I have multiple homeworks and quizzes every class day in summer school.  Is this a good plan?

"Have I lost my $ 1100 security deposit for good? [mo]. I told this landlord I wanted the apartment and she took it off the market for approxamitely 2 weeks. The rent is 1100 a month and I gave her my security deposit of that much. I changed my mind about moving in as I found a cheaper option and I would have had to double rent for a month and a half. Is there any legal way to get my deposit back or have I lost the  money? This is all happening in missouri.

This was the email my potential landlord sent:

Not only have you wasted my time but you’ve cost me income. You did not take responsibility to know when your current lease ended. On July 11th when asked in writing, you confirmed you DID want to take possession on July 15th as previously agreed to verbally. On July 12th you informed me you don’t. Your current lease termination date should have been considered before you committed to take possession of my apartment July 15th when you gave me your deposit on June 29th. The unit was available July 1st and I compromised and split the month with you. From June 29th to July 12th, you still have not provided the requested information to complete your application.

I have now lost, at the least, one month’s full rent of $1,100. I’ve paid for two background checks at $25 each due to the information you provided for your social security number was incorrect. Both of our time is valuable and I’ve spent at least 8 hours dealing with this issue. All totaled I’m out, at least, $1,150 and I need to begin the entire process over.

For the above reasons, your deposit is forfeited.

"Need Divorce Help. I'm going through a divorce right now and I was hoping to get some guidance here. Im currently stationed in Virginia but was married in Alabama and thats where my soon to be ex-wife is currently living with our 2 children. So we have a mutual agreement contract which states she'll be taking all payments of the second vehicle and Ill be giving her a certain amount of money for child support until our children have reached the age of 18. The contract is signed by both of us and is notarized as well.

So on the beginning of this month when the contract was supposed to take place she told that she didnt want to buy the car from me because she doesn't want it.  So now Im stuck paying for another car I cant afford and was wondering if itll be worth getting an attorny to help with that along with the divorce paperwork. Like what would happen if I got an attorney to press that case for me? What would be the negative consequence of her breaching a contract? Or would I be out of more money than before because I now have to take that route. I was also hoping someone could tell me how long we have to be separated in Alabamas laws in order to file for divorce. Ive googled and I cant find anything on an amount of time we need to be separated. I know Virginias laws and they're easy to find but thats not the case for Alabama since we were married there. 

Im planning on getting an attorney but I want to have as much knowledge as possible before I do. If you have any questions please ask. I'm activr military and Ive already spoken with legal quite a few times but it always comes down to then telling me to find an attorney in Alabama without any real guidance.

"US/AL Son was injured at a local gym. Looking for the right way to handle this even if the financial responsibility is ours. There's a local obstacle gym that we pay a monthly fee for our son to attend.  He's 11.  There are trainers on staff for structured play time as well as ""free play"" where the kids can do the various obstacles at their leisure.  During free play, the trainers are suppose to wander through the obstacles observing the kids and making sure no one gets hurt. During free play time, my son fell from about 10 feet up and landed on the safety mat.  The way he landed shattered his elbow and broke his arm in two places.  This injury required immediate surgery to correct.  He now has wires holding his elbow together.  Another surgery will be necessary in a few months to remove the wires because his bones need to be able to continue to grow.  We have insurance but have had to pay the co pay on two emergency room visits as well as the surgery and follow up doctors appointments.  I've contacted their insurance company but the rep has been infuriatingly difficult to get in touch with.  I've spoken to him once out of 7 attempts.  I've spoken to a local attorney but they declined to represent me.  I'm not looking for a million dollar payout, but would appreciate help with the expenses I've incurred.  What are my options?  Will it just be classified as an accident and I eat the cost and move on?  Do I contact my insurance company and let them fight it out with the other?

"Landlord gave house to his brother, trying to remove me. Basically, it's pretty straightforward. I moved into my current house last january, after starting a new job. I paid my first three months in advance as a sign of good faith, and lived here since. My last position ended in November of 2016, and I didn't have a job until May. Obviously, being unemployed made it hard, even with a roommate and girlfriend, to always make the rent and bills. (my girlfriend had her own place til May, roommate moved out in may.) In March, april, and May, I paid the rent before the fifth of the month; in part because the 1st fell on a weekend. I was a week late in June and July because my new position and bills and my car dying made money extremely tight. I had originally signed a lease from january 2016-january 2017, but because he was busy, we didn't resign the new one until march, so it goes until march 2017. I cant' find a paper copy, but I was under the impression there were no late fees until the fifth. As of July 9th, my landlord basically let his brother be in charge, as he didn't want to do the landlord thing anymore. As of the 12th, out of nowhere, he sent me a letter saying I owe 175 in back rent (late fees) for march to july, or I must vacate the property by the 22nd of July.

"[AB, Canada] Parking service absurd charges after cancellation. I had a monthly parking service with Impark and I no longer needed to use their parking lot after April. I cancelled the service online at the end of April and thought everything was done. During May, they mailed me a letter saying I owed them $52.50 (monthly payment for may) + $25.00 (rejected payment charge) + $15 (late payment admin fee) + $0.75 (service tax). I called their customer service and they told me that their policy is if don't cancel before the 7th of a month, I also have to pay for next month. The payments were supposed to be automated, but my credit card was lost/stolen at the start of May, so they also added on extra charges because they couldn't charge my credit card. I explained to them I haven't received a new card yet and they told me there was nothing they could do because that was their only accepted form of payment. I initially signed up for the service through the phone, and didn't sign any contract; however, they say that since I chose to use their services, I agreed to their terms and conditions.


I didn't deal with it right away because I had to go on vacation 1.5 months. Now that I'm back, I see that they have added on even more additional charges. On top of the $93.25, they also added on $50 (rejected payment charge) + $30 (late admin fee)+ $1.5 (tax) for the months of June and July. Now they say that I owe them $174.75 or my debt will be collected by a collection agency and will affect my credit.

"I'm currently in contact with a renter about renting a home and his emails sound a tiny bit fishy. I need immediate help before responding to him again!. I sent an email to this renter about renting a home two days ago. He responded today and said he was out of the country and will be back soon. Then he asked me a few info about myself. My age, name, when I'm planning to move, how many people, etc. It seemed a tiny bit strange that he would ask me about my age but I brushed it off. At the bottom of the email he gave me the address to the home. I google mapped it and it looks NOTHING like the home that was pictured on the website where I found the rental. I looked up the address and apparently it's ""pending"" on a SELLER. Now it's getting weird. The guy says it's for rent but yet the same exact house is on SALE on several other websites.

He responded again and said this:
""Please go and take a look at the outside of the house first, and then come back to me if you like the house, so I can send the keys.

What I want to know is, WHY would he want to send me the keys to that house to MY address when I haven't even agreed to rent the place or haven't even seen it with the renter. I really do not want to go forward with this if i'm getting warning signs already, and this would be my first rental so I desperately need to know how the process works and if this has ever happened to anyone.",1
"(California) roommate let in squatter, now I'm homeless. I'm renting a 2 bedroom in LA and got a new roommate, who signed a lease and got approved by the management company. 6 months later she said she was going away for a month and gave her keys to ""a friend"" who may stay a few nights. A month later, she never returned. She told me via Facebook messenger that she'd be back in a few weeks for a while, then said this friend wanted to sign on to the lease. I told my roommate I wasn't comfortable with her friend doing that. About a week before the end of my roommate's lease, I told her ""friend"" that she had to leave, since I needed a new roommate and she wouldn't let anyone see her room. I asked for the keys and she assaulted me, throwing me on the ground and then calling the police saying I'd attacked her. The police came and threatened to arrest both of us, I cleared out and got a restraining order. Despite this, I couldn't get her out of the apartment and I no longer feel safe there. As of July 1, my roommate no longer is on the lease, but the squatter won't leave. My actual roommate and I have told her many times to go, the police came by 4 other times and even threatened to arrest her, and the management company has served her a 3 days notice. She's still there and it's become clear to me that she squats habitually-- she knows the laws too well.

Questions--
1. What can I do to get rent and damages from the roommate who let her in? What kind of lawyer would handle this?
2. The management knew about the squatter and hasn't acted. Is there anything I can get them to do?
3. Are there any other options besides the management evicting me and my roommate (the people on the lease) to get her out?",1
"[Philadelphi, PA] a bartender physically and verbally assaulted me last night, bruises on my body. Need advice.. Hello. This sort of thing never happens to me when I'm out so I'm just looking for advice/info. 
My friends and I were out at a bar last night, one friend and I were a bit drunk and being stupid, there was a cup of plastic forks/knives on the table and we spilled it over (admittedly this was immature and stupid on my end but I would have cleaned it up). As we do this a bartender walks up to my friend and grabs his shirt and demands he comes with him. So I interjected and said no don't go with him. Then another bartender comes up and physically slams me to the ground, then straddles on top of me for over a half hour. Meanwhile he is aggressively pulling my left arm over my throat and choking me, so I try to fight back and get him off me. He's also laughing at me and saying things like ""you're a faggot. You can't do shit. No one is going to help you"". Then my cell phone falls out of my pocket and another worker walks over, picks it up and takes it away somewhere. 
Eventually after a half hour of struggling they let me up and leave, and I had to argue with multiple workers to give me my property back. The guys wouldn't give me their names of course. 
I woke up today with a large bruise on my right arm, my left rotator cuff is killing me, and my neck is red. 
They could have easily asked us to leave or thrown me out the door, but instead they brought me close to the back of the restaurant and assaulted me. 

Can businesses/bars do this to customers? Do I have any legal action I can take? Multiple of my friends witnessed and are willing to testify. 

Thanks so much. This was ridiculous.",0
"[California] Sister got in the car drunk, drove off with her kids without a booster seat, then tries running me over.. I'm still in disbelief of what happened yesterday. 

So my sister got drunk alone after an argument with her husband. She drank at least 2 12oz beers. She's small, so it effected her noticeably. 

She then commences a shitstorm on Facebook, arguing with random strangers on a parenting page, on how to be a proper parent. Oh, the irony. 

Anyhow, she tells me about it, explaining how she was in the right and everyone else was flat out wrong. I disagreed with her and pointed out the dangers of exposing your identity like that to random strangers. 

That sparked a heated argument. 

Long story short; 

*Sshe got in the car with her kids

* I got behind the car to note down her plate numbers 

* She then backs up into me without any regards for my safety

* I stand in front of the car as I call the police

* She speeds towards me, probably thinking I will move out the way

* I jumped on the hood

* She accelerated over 30 mph to get me off, presumably 

* She stops, I get off because I was convinced she will kill me

* Once I was back inside the house, I noticed the booster seat by the door, meaning she drove off drunk with at least on kid, both under 5 years of age, without proper safety measures



.................

This all happened yesterday. She is not home, as I imagine she does not want to face the consequences. But I am ignorant of the law, so I do not know how to proceed. 

Can she be charged with a DUI the next day once sobered down?

What charges can I have against her?

I would prefer to keep the family together, but she cannot get away without some form of punishment.",0
"Is there anything I can do about this? Theft by deception in PA. So I am pretty frustrated... someone I know is currently incarcerated (I'll call him Steve) and in the prison there are a few select TVs that inmates can have in their cells. For whatever reason the prison leaves it up to the inmates to arrange the buying and selling of the TVs when someone who has one is released. So an inmate who has a TV, Jay, is being released tomorrow (Monday). Steve wanted to buy the TV from Jay so we arranged that I would meet up with Jay's father, Sean, and give him $110 for it, then he would let Jay know he received the money, and give Steve the TV.

However, after giving Sean the $110, he claimed to let Jay know he received it, however Jay has not given Steve the TV, claims his father did not receive the money, and in fact has ""sold"" it to someone else by having their family member western union money somewhere and is in the process of ""selling"" it to another inmate as well! The TV remains in his cell. I have no idea what his plan is when he leaves tomorrow and owes 3 people this TV. And Sean has stopped responding to my text messages and phone calls about returning my $110.

My question is, if Steve does not receive the TV (which is seeming incredibly likely) is there ANYTHING I can do legally? Is theft by deception even a crime in PA? I don't know if Jay and Sean are their real names even, but I have ""Sean""'s phone number and the text message where it was laid out that we were meeting up to exchange the money for the TV. And they can obviously check to see that Steve has not received the TV in the jail. It's just extra complicated bc everything between Jay and Steve and Steve and I was verbal obviously.",0
"I have a feeling my HOA is doing some fishy stuff.... A little bit of information: I just bought a condo this spring, my neighbor above me is a housing inspector, so I know it's not terrible. But the buildings are in bad shape. The climate is not ideal for such stucco buildings and over the last couple years it's apparent that the winter maintenance people were over salting and rusting the stairways, discoloring walls, etc.. The buildings are 1980's stucco on frame, practically falling apart. There are floating board walks that are rotting, and walls that are cracking, holes in dry wall covered parking(fire code offense). There is just a general lack of maintenance that has this place practically falling apart.

The budget has me really shaking my head. My monthly HOA just went up 10% from $220 to $230.

I really want to post a photo of the budget, cause it seems really fishy. I will if anyone requests it.

Some examples: $500 for telephone and internet, yet that's all paid for by tenants... So why are they charging us, and for what??

$5k for pool maintenance plus $500 for chemicals and another $800 for repairs. Why would the HOA have to pay for chemicals if they are contracting out the pool maintenance?

And $14k in electrical, yet residents pay their own electricity... What the hell is that for? $29k for sewage? I don't know what I'm talking about but isn't all that paid for with Taxes?

The HOA president owns a couple condos and rents them out and his dad works for the HOA with a grounds management contract. Something just doesn't feel right here. Should I get umbrella home insurance to cover this place falling apart? What can I/should I do without pissing them off too much and going after me?",1
"Being Held Hostage In a Lease by Roommate. I am currently residing in Florida

In April, I made the personal decision to leave my apartment due to personal conflicts with my roommate. We are both on the lease and I asked to either have my name removed from the lease, or to terminate all together. She refused to comply with either of those options out of spite. There is no contractual agreement between me and my roommate stating that we would pay our share of the rent, only a contract with the landlord(the lease). I have been paying the second half of the rent out of fear of what may happen if I choose to stop. From what I understand reading Florida law and finding bits and pieces, the landlord would undergo this process to collect rent: Once the rent is X amount of days late, the landlord will file a 3-Day eviction notice. The tenants will have 3 days to either pay the late rent, vacate the apartment, or fight the eviction in court. Now with that being said, having the eviction to my renter's history IS NOT A BOTHERSOME to me. I also understand the landlord may sue for missing rent. Being evicted and having to pay overdue rent for the month sounds like a better deal to me than continuing to pay rent for an apartment I'm not living in until December. My main concern is the retaliation of my roommate, and fact checking the eviction process. Is there anything legally she may pursue in a small claims court against me directly beings that there is no contractual agreement directly between the two of us, stating we would split the rent? Is there any actions that the landlord may take that is much more serve than eviction/suing for missing rent? Does my roommate have a case to fight the eviction in court?",1
"[Ohio] Possible kidnapping advice. Ohio: OK, so a friend of mine is in the middle of a HUGE cluster and I could really use some advice to pass on. I'm not even sure where to begin… My friend is 19 and a completely disabled quadriplegic, his mother is his full-time caregiver, but she has become very estranged to her husband (yes they are still married) and they lived under the same roof up until recently. My friend has three younger siblings, all of whom were just taken by the dad to another town and he won't disclose where they are staying. The mom called the police and they said they can't do anything unless there are court documents filed. Isn't this kidnapping? Since he has taken them, they have come back to the house couple times, but only for a couple hours.
  
One of the biggest problems is that the mom is my friend's full-time caregiver and is completely dependent on the dad to pay bills and take care of things financially, but he doesn't include her on any of the financial information. This makes finding a legitimate lawyer very difficult. There is a lot more to this whole situation, including years of manipulation and mental abuse. It seems his main goal is to discredit her and threaten her with getting full custody of the kids and making her out to be the bad guy. It sounds like he has been able to turn the three youngest kids against her and is using money and gifts to manipulate them. The mom has no idea where the dad is getting the money to afford a second home or these gifts (including a car), especially because the dad recently put the family on Medicaid and food stamps.
  
What are the first steps I should recommend for the mom? Thanks in advance for any help/advice you can offer.",0
"(NC) Apartment is infested with mice, want to break lease.. We moved into the apartment in April, 12 month lease.  Several weeks ago we noticed evidence of mice in one of out bathrooms.  We thoroughly cleaned the droppings, notified the property manager, and 3-4 days later an exterminator came and sealed the holes in the wall where the mice were getting in.  Last week, we noticed new evidence of mice in our kitchen.  We notified the property manager again, and they came out and did a more thorough inspection to find that mice are chewing holes in our kitchen, both bathrooms, and the bedroom where our 2 year old sleeps.  We want to break the lease, the complex wants us to give 60 days notice and pay an additional 2 months after we move out.  Even if they fill all these holes, the building has a larger mouse problem and the rodents problem will persist.  

I am arguing that they did not comply with the NC General Statute 42-42: Make all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition.  There is also an 'imminent danger' clause that specifies a rat infestation, but nothing about mice.  

We keep the apartment clean, never any food or dirty dishes left out.   

Will this evidence be sufficient that the apartment is not inhabitable? The complex has offered us the buyout, which is our lease goes 60 days from the date we sign, and we pay a buyout fee of 2 months rent, so we effectively pay for 4 months that we are not living there.  Should I sign the notice to move out they provided?  Can we just move out and not pay anything?  I have reached out to the city housing department to see if they think this situation is 'uninhabitable'.  

Thanks for any advice!",1
"Wife of 3 years and I getting divorced; she wants a ""settlement"" and spousal support but we have no kids. What can I expect? (Illinois). After three years together, my wife (32) and I (36) have decided to get divorced. This is her third marriage and my first. She has 4 children by her two ex-husbands (we have no children together, thank God). She moved out a few weeks ago, and I haven't gotten a divorce attorney yet.

Yesterday I received a settlement proposal from her attorney. I'm pretty much dumbfounded. She wants $40,000 cash and spousal support. I make a very good living, and when we got married she quit her job (working as a hairdresser) to be a stay at home mom to her children, which I was fine with. We have no joint assets. She and her children moved into my home, and I paid for all of our bills and most of her kids', although she gets a decent amount of child support each month from her exes.

I'm more or less in shock over this. I am hiring an attorney asap, but what can I expect from this, realistically? I've never gotten divorced and neither has anyone in my family, so I don't know what's standard. Would I really have to pay her ""support""? 
She quit her job by HER CHOICE to take care of HER CHILDREN while I supported her to do that, so I didn't think I would have to be paying support for the decision she made. I can understand and expect it if she wanted to stay home with our children. I figured we would just go our separate ways with the things we brought into the marriage (no big purchases like homes or cars were made while married), and now I feel completely naive.

tl;dr: Getting divorced from wife of 3 years; she wants spousal support and $40k even though we have no children together",0
"Large cockroach infestation and an unprofessional landlord. I'm a college student and I signed a lease for a small studio with a good friend. I was supposed to move in two weeks ago yet due to a bathroom renovation and a cockroach infestation, I have been unable to move in. This is causing me a lot of problems as I have a part time job and am a full time student and living out of my car is becoming increasingly difficult. I was wondering if there would be any way to break my lease. With a cockroach infestation I know the studio is deemed uninhabitable, except the landlord has made a half-assed attempt of fixing the problem. The landlord has sent exterminators, yet realistically after talking to the exterminators myself the roaches won't be eradicated for another 2-3 weeks based on the scale of the infestation. The landlord has refunded me one weeks worth of rent and has told me that I should move in. I will not be moving in as there are  a ton of cockroaches still present. Is there any possible way I could break my lease, despite my landlord's lazy attempt to get rid of the cockroaches? Any and all advice is appreciated!! This is my first lease so I'm still learning.

I provided a little extra background to my situation:
I am in California if that matters at all.

My landlord has made it clear to me that she does not care about me and that she just wants me to move in so I can start paying rent. She has lied to me and always comes up with new excuses about other issues in the studio. 

The reason I want to break my lease is that there is an apartment that is cheaper, ready to move in, bug free, and has a more reputable landlord. Not only would I be able to move in asap I would be saving money as well.",1
"(US - CA) Question about wording of rental agreement on house, RE: repairs and damages. First time renting a house and had a question about this portion:

*Except as provided by law or by a prior written consent of LANDLORD, TENANT shall make every repairs to the premises, including fixing nail holes in the walls or painting dirty walls caused by TENANT, at TENANT’s sole expense during the term of the tenancy. TENANTs are responsible for minor repair up to and including the cost of $60 and a deductible of 30 dollars for each repair when LANDLORD is called. TENANT agrees to pay for all repairs, replacements and maintenance required by TENANT’s misconduct or negligence or that of TENANT’s family, pets, licensees and guests, including but not limited to any damage done by wind or rain caused by leaving windows open and/pr by overflow of water, or stoppage of water pipes, or any other damage to appliances, carpeting or the building in general. At LANDLORD’s option, such charges shall be paid immediately or be regarded as additional rent to be paid no later than the next monthly payment date following such repairs. LANDLORD shall be responsible for replacement of major items, such as roof or water heater degraded through natural wear and tear.*

The first sentence makes it sound like I am on the hook for everything. But then subsequent sentences appear to clarify that I only take care of minor damages up to $60 and the landlord takes care of anything more than that (assuming I didn't cause the damage.)

Just making sure this isn't sneaky wording that means I will pay for everything.

I'm assuming this is a standard part of a rental contract, but my lack of experience wants to make sure.

"Is subleasing okay if it says nothing about it in the lease (California)?. Located in California.

I'm renting a house from someone, and subleasing out the other two bedrooms in the house.  The terms on the leases I write go through the end of August, because it's a university town, and that's when the majority of the leases are up in the town. 

Today one of the people I live with texted me to find out if he had to pay August's rent if we found someone to take over the lease before then.  I told him no, but only if we found someone by Monday (I'm flying out on vacation on Tuesday, and won't be back before the end of the month).  

He asked why by then, doesn't he have the whole month, and I pointed out that I'll still be living here, I'd like to be comfortable with whoever is in the other room (ideally, the other person in the third room would need to be comfortable with them as well).  

He said he'd be subletting his room either way.

I'm not comfortable with him deciding who'd be living in the room without me or the other tenant also meeting and feeling okay with the individual, and because I'll be gone until the end of the month, possibly early August, I don't know how he'd find someone to sublet the room to while I'm gone, letting them move in on the first, if I don't even know I'll be back by then.  I'd like to tell him that because the lease doesn't explicitly give him permission to sublet the room, he isn't allowed to, but I don't know that that's the case.  

If it says nothing about it one way or the other in the lease, is he allowed to sublet the room?

"Can this health care provider still come after me for a 7-year old bill that is off my credit report?. In 2010, I broke a bone and had to have emergency care and aftercare at a local university health system, because I had no insurance. I paid part of the bill, but lost my job, so it was turned in to their own collections division, which I tried to work with, but they were extremely uncooperative and were unwilling to accept a reasonable effort to pay, so life went on, and I never heard from them again. Surprisingly, this bill was removed from my credit report last December, which I thought was odd, seeing as how it hadn't been 7 years. 

Now I have Medicare and Medicaid and my primary care physician is trying to refer me back to this health system for treatment. When I called to make the appt., the woman asked me if I had ever lived at my old address, which was strange, because I had since moved away from this city, then moved back and registered at university health under my new address. It frightened me, so I just hung up. I'm scared to call back for fear that she saw something on my account that tipped her off that I owed them money. Since they have their own internal collections department, it never would have been sold to an outside collection agency, so would this still be an outstanding debt?

Obviously, if I'm on Medicaid, I'm poor and I can't afford to pay them, and as nasty as they were last time, I don't want to deal with this when I'm already sick. I need to see this specialist, but this is the only place in this small town that accepts both Medicare and Medicaid, so I'm sort of stuck.

Can they still come after me, since they retained the account in house? TIA for any advice you can give me.",0

Long story back here, but I'm not scared of posting this on my main anymore. 


Brother, boyfriend, and I have been renting my mother's home for $500/month. 



Mother planned a fight with the boyfriend, she got what she wanted in the argument. Boyfriend agreed to move out by August 1st. Later that day, mother sends a text to me, brother, and boyfriend that boyfriend is to be out by 5 PM on July 31st. 



This all happened on July 1st. 



Yesterday, July 13th, her fiance attempted to force his way in to the house after boyfriend denied him entry. Boyfriend was assaulted by my mother's fiance. Police were called, and reports have been made. My brother informs our mother we will all be leaving by the end of the month. Later in the day, mother sends a text to brother and I acknowledging our leaving the home.



Today, July 14th, my mother told my brother she will be initiating eviction proceedings against my boyfriend. 



Here are the facts so far, as I know them:

1. My mother has not provided a written notice to quit or cure, nor has she done so orally.

2. My mother has failed to maintain the property. There are major foundation issues that may inhibit her ability to rent the house out again, if she so chooses. These foundation issues threaten the habitability of the house.

3. She's wasting her time trying to file an eviction since the courts run on their own schedule, not hers and since boyfriend has already notified her that he'll be moving out.

"[CA] Business owner sold business, is new owner responsible?. Asking for a good friend.  Had some custom work done to his truck: application of a ""ceramic nano coat"" to protect it while off-roading.  Was supposed to be the whole truck.  

After a pretty intense weekend wheeling thru brush and what not, friend came back and washed truck and found the ceramic coating was only applied to hood, bumper, and sides up to wheel well.  Sides and bed of truck didn't get the treatment and are scratched to hell.  Cost of treatment was originally ~$6k.

Normally I know one should sue in small claims if the business fails to make it right.

However, while my friend was out wheeling the guy sold the business and permanently moved overseas.  Apparently he screwed a lot of people in the process, not just my friend, with incomplete or shoddy work on some pretty high-end vehicles.  Up until this the guy had a stellar reputation.

The new business bought the lease, name, and assets, but does that mean they also bought the past accounts, responsibility for the work done by previous owner, etc?  

The new shop owner is upset at the previous owner but isn't cutting my friend any sort of deal on making him whole - is charging him to fix the paint and cost of the ceramic coating again.    

On the one hand, my friend scratched the hell out his own truck by hitting the brush, but on the other hand he thought he had a complete ceramic coating.  Where the coating was installed it performed as expected - no damage.  

Cost to repair the paint and finish applying the ceramic coat will be under $10k, the max small claims here in California, but from whom should my friend try and recoup?

Realistically, what are my friend's options here?",0
"How old do you have to be to own a dog?. My ex husband recently allowed our 17 year old daughter to get a pit bull. The animal was free because the owner didn't want it. My daughter has paid for the things it needs (food, crate, collar, etc.) Ex husband has not paid for anything. 

The dog is living at his house. He got mad at my daughter and told her she needed to take the dog to my house. I said NO. That's his dog, his responsibility. Ex husband believes the dog is the property of our daughter and therefore the animal is her responsibility. I said he's wrong.

I made it clear to my daughter that the dog cannot come here. I already have 2 dogs, which is the most my rental contract allows me to have.

Also, I am not interested in replacing either of these animals if/when they die. Pet ownership is expensive and time consuming. I have already obligated myself to these two dogs as long as they live and that's that.

I told my ex husband before he got her the pet that it would not be coming to my home. I also told him I didn't think it was a good idea to get our daughter a dog at this point in her life. At age 17, she has a lot going on with schooling and work. Also, if she wants to get her own place to live, many landlords will not allow aggressive breeds.

But since she is a minor, can she legally own the dog? Or is the dog the property of her father?

For example, if the dog were to cause damage to another person's property who would be liable? I insist ex husband is liable because it is a pet he harbors on his property.

So what happens when my daughter turns 18 and her dad gets mad at her again and tells her to leave and take the dog with her? Whose dog is it then?

"A shit ""friend"". A little over a year ago, against my advice (NEVER buy or sell a car or house from/to a friend), my husband took out a bank loan to purchase a vehicle from a buddy. The loan has been paid off for MONTHS and we still have not received said car or title. Maintenance had to be done, and every time he has fixed one thing he has damaged another part. Being a BMW, the parts have to be ordered each time. Friday he said he had a family emergency, naturally I don't believe a damn word. Whatever. What's another day at this point? Yday he says he left a light on in the vehicle, of course this ran the battery down. He had to take the battery to the shop he works at to charge it. Fine. Get it done. Never heard back. Today, we still haven't heard anything after several texts and messages. 

I've been ready to wash my hands of this since the very beginning. Husband has finally reached the point where he is ready to take legal action. Of course, we do not have the money to do this. I'm determined enough, we will find a way to pay for what we need to to get this taken care of, including him paying for the legal fees (if possible) in the end. 

I believe we paid $2500 for it. I've told him if we don't have the car, he will be paying for the loan we took our in full-time including interest. 

Ive never had to take legal action on anything and have no idea what the first step should be. I assume simply calling around tomorrow to local lawyers would be a good place to start. 

I'm posting in hopes someone can tell me a correct, or at least good, route to go or start on. Obviously at this point I'm just angry and tired of his bullshit. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm in Texas if that matters. Thank you!",0
"[MO] Possession and paraphernalia citation. Last night I got hit with a possession and paraphernalia citation. I'm in Missouri so their new decriminalization law of marijuana keeps the fine to only $25 but that's not all I am worried about. 

I was sitting at my buddies house waiting for him to come home, he was taking longer than usual so I had been sitting there for a solid 20 minutes or so and then some cops pull up. They tell me one of the neighbors called about a suspicious car (which is BS because I have had this car for 3 years and am at this buddies house at a minimum of once a week, I am 100% sure they have seen my car on multiple occasions) 

I wasn't smoking, not even a cig, my car was off and I was just browsing Reddit. When the cop started to talk to me he noticed a blunt on my floorboard. They of course confiscated everything, but they were very nice about it, probably understanding it was just coincidence and I wasn't even doing anything. 

I ended up getting a citation for possession and paraphernalia and my court date is in October. Now what I'm really worried about is the fact I want to be a firefighter, I'm already certified but I'm worried about getting hired somewhere now. I haven't been smoking very long, and was going to quit once I started taking some more classes in the fall. Is there any way I can keep this off my record? It would pretty much destroy my whole plan in life if I can't be a firefighter, I've been training and taking classes for it since high school.

"[IL] Customer leaves car in Drive, turns off ignition. Mechanic starts car from the outside, car ends up crashing with minor damage. Customer wants compensation.. Personally, I'm more leaning towards the mechanic (my friend) being at fault for failing to follow safety precautions.

When someone hands you a Rifle, the first thing you do is check if it is loaded, even if you literally just witnessed that person emptying the Rifle right in front of you.  In the same way I feel like a car mechanic should do the same and follow basic safety precaution, like checking if the car is indeed in park before starting.  

But then, I'm not sure how stupid another human being has to be to hand someone a loaded Rifle and tell them ""Oh it's not loaded""... aka 'Let's leave my car in Drive, turn off ignition and invite a car mechanic to do repairs on your car'.  I feel like the Customer does have some liability in this case, but I'm not a lawyer.  

Also, I believe it was an older car that made it possible for this stupidity to happen.  I'm not a car expert but I'm pretty sure you have to step on the brakes before ignition on modern cars?  At least that's the way I learned in Driver's Ed when I was 16.  Always step on brakes before starting.  

No one got hurt, the repair amount is really small, I think about $500 bucks for minor bumper damage.  

But I'm wondering ultimately who is at fault considering the possibility that someone could have actually died from this.

"Not renewing lease; lease does not state notice period for non-renewel. My partner and I live in a unit that is owned by, for all intents and purposes, a slumlord. Broken windows in common areas have been unrepaired for the past year, we don't have means to properly heat the unit, other repairs to the property are ignored entirely when brought to how attention. We have no intention of signing another lease with him at the end of the month when our year here is over. 

We are located in Maine. 

Looking at our current lease we noticed several things. 
 1. We signed in July of 2016 with the terms intended that it would end on August 1st,2017. Our lease instead states August 1, 2016 as the termination date. It however goes on to state that rent must be paid over 12 months OR for the 12 months rental amount. 
2. There is no written term for when a renewal lease must be signed and no written or otherwise discussed term for how much notice must be provided if we choose not to sign another lease. 
3. There is no written term stating that the lease defaults to monthly following the initial lease. However Maine does state that if payment is given and accepted following the end of a lease it is assumed to be a monthly lease for as long as payment occurs and is accepted. 

We looked at another unit today with a landlord that I have a positive history with and are filling out a rental application. The new unit would be move in ready on August 1st.  With our current lease, how much notice do we have to provide to potentially avoid and legal recourse on our current landlord's end? From what I could tell it looks like we are safe to simply not pay August rent and give him notice prior to August. However I am also not a lawyer.",1
"Visa and Marriage. Hi,  
  
Here's a quick overview of my problem :  
  
I'm French, my girlfriend is American, we've been together for 2 years (she came to France for a year, and i went 2 times to the US for 3 months).  
  
We want to get married and live together in the US, but i currently don't have any visa except for the ESTA 3-months tourist visa.  
  
I came to the US 2 weeks ago with the intent to stay for 3 months, get married, and figure something out to stay here legally.  
  
I ran into some trouble at the border with the officer telling me that i can't apply for any visa after getting married, as this would be illegal.  
  
Fair enough, i explained i just wanted to get married, go back to france after the 3 months and come back again right after to do the visa, at which point he got angry and told me i couldn't even get married on US soil (which is total bullshit based on my researches)  
  
We're not really sure what to do at this point.  
Apparently getting married and acquiring a visa are not seen as a good thing, so maybe i should find a way to get a visa without getting married, and get married afterwards ?  
  
From what i saw there's only 2 visa i could apply for : K-1 and CR1.  
  
For now my gf makes enough money to support both of us, but eventually i'd like to work as well.  
No rush though, for now we simply want to be together, even if i can't work.  
  
Here's my plan for now : Get married, go back to France once my current 3-months visa is expired, apply for a long term tourist visa, go back to the US whenever the tourist visa is approved, apply for a K-1 visa once i'm in the US.  
I'm worried i might run into trouble because of the marriage.

"[NJ] Deadbeat/absentee father wants his share of a settlement despite having zero connection with our family and the lawsuit we filed.. My sister recently passed away under some very bothersome circumstances. My family has been involved in a lawsuit over this, which is reaching its end point. We were recently informed that before everything is finalized, my father is legally entitled to inquire about his possible share of the settlement. This naturally caused a collective ""WTF?!"" moment throughout my family, as he his an absentee deadbeat who hasn't had contact with the family in well over a decade, and even when contacted about becoming a co-executor of my sister's estate, he waived his rights by not giving a fuck and ignoring it. Here are some key points:

* My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate.

* My sister passed away as a legal adult; after emancipation.

* This lawsuit was initially filed by my mother as an individual, and soon turned into it being on behalf of my sister's estate, as she became the sole executor.

* My father waived his rights when it came to becoming co-executor of my sister's estate. He had an opportunity to pursue it but didn't, and has absolutely no association with the lawsuit, my sister's estate, or the family.

* My father hasn't had any contact with my family for almost 13-14 years, and has never made any attempt to make contact. He knows very little about us, made no effort to contact us and seek information regarding my sister's passing.

* My father owes tens of thousands of dollars in child support, and is a tax dodger. He's been to jail several times over both. Our attorney and the judge handling this knows, as we've provided extensive documentation about this.",0
"[New York] Landlord entering apartment at any time without prior notice, for the remaining duration of the lease. *Upstate New York, not New York City for clarification*

&amp;nbsp;

It feels as if my landlord is being very intrusive and providing me no privacy.  After ~6 months of minimal communication with my landlord, I receive an email stating that he will be entering at any point for the remaining duration of the lease, to perform ""emergency repairs"" without giving any notice.

&amp;nbsp;

I responded that I would like ~24 hour notice before he plans to enter, but he disregarded that.  He claims this is allowed, as the lease states ""he or authorized personnel have the right to enter to make normal repairs, improvements, do code work, do maintenance work, or do other construction without prior notice.""

&amp;nbsp;

I have been trying to locate applicable laws, and the closest I have found is New York Real Property Law § 235, but I am unsure of how well they apply to the situation.  For example, § 235-d (1) seemed to be relevant, but it begins with ""Notwithstanding any other provision of law, within a city having a population of one million or more ...""  However, my city is located in upstate New York, and has a population of roughly 30,000.

&amp;nbsp;

I suppose my two main questions are:

* Given the lease clause, is my landlord actually allowed to enter at any point in time, for any reason, without proper notice?

* If so, what is the suggested course of action if he does enter under those circumstances?  Contact local police?

&amp;nbsp;

**Edit:** I should clarify that while he claims he's making ""emergency repairs"" the work he is actually doing is along the lines of painting &amp; tightening loose screws",1
"Question Regarding Possible Home Owner Action (USA - SC) (XPost from /r/RealEstate). Seventeen months ago I purchased a house in Mount Pleasant, SC located in a new development. The lot I chose backed up to a relatively large ""common space."" In total six houses backed up to this area, and I was told before I moved in that this area would be maintained. I do not have that in writing, but I did pay DOUBLE the lot fee because I backed up to an amenity.

When we moved in, there was construction everywhere. Houses were still being built and the common space with constantly covered in trash, and never maintained or mowed. I was patient because it was so hectic with all the construction and all the houses surrounding this area weren't finished.

But now here we are, the development is basically finished, and this area is still a total disaster. Landscapers come and go, mowing all the other areas around the development while this is ignored. Weeds, construction debris and trash occupy this space now.
I have written the building company, Cal Atlantic, incessantly. I have written the HOA which is called CMG, incessantly. Nothing is done. So I am writing to see what other avenues I can pursue. What might get their attention? Better Business Bureau? Are there any city resources available to me? Any channels I can explore? I'm at my wit's end and I thought this community might have some good ideas.

Thanks in advance!

"(WI) Apartment lease ended June 30th, I moved out, landlord wants me to pay rent for July or will file suit.. Hello and thank you for reading. I live in Wisconsin.

In June 2016 I signed a lease that commenced on July 1st, 2016 and ended on June 30th, 2017. This was my first time renting an apartment and I was unaware that it is common etiquette to provide 30 days notice before moving. I did not provide 30 days notice, instead I messaged my landlord a few days before moving. Today (7/11/17) I just received a text message from my landlord stating that I must pay the rent for July or they will take me to court, and that I should have given 30 days notice. 

Here's the details:
* The term of my lease commenced on July 1st, 2016 and ended on June 30th, 2017
* There was no automatic renewal clause
* I did not receive written notice 15-30 days prior to the ending of the lease that there was an automatic renewal clause 
* Nothing was written in the lease stating I had to give 30 days (or any number of days) notice before leaving

The only relevant wording I can find in the lease are these two statements:

* ""Upon giving written notice no later than 60 days before the expiration of the term of this Lease, the Tenant may renew this Lease for an additional term"" 

* ""During the last 30 days of this Lease, the Landlord or the Landlord's agents will have the privilege of displaying the usual 'For Sale' or 'For Rent' or 'Vacancy' signs on the Premises""
 
I feel bad for breaking common etiquette and not letting my landlord know prior to 30 days, but I'm not reading anything from Wisconsin that states I have to legally give 30 days notice. So, legally, does my landlord have a case against me?

I really appreciate your advice and time.",1
"Broken glass and broken career.  Location: Los Angela's California

I was at a bar last week with some friends and some time during the night I was at the bar getting a drink and when I turned around an extremely drunk man smashed his glass into mine while he wildly gestured about something. 

At first I was in shock since he basically smashed a glass in my face but when I looked down my entire right hand was a bloody mess. I shouted and one of the bartenders saw this and called the ambulance. I  was furious with the guy who gave me a fuck of comment before the manager on staff sat me down and helped me until the ambulance got there. 

I'm at the hospital and during the exam it was discovered that 3 of the tendons in my hand had been cut and I need surgery to repair them. 

The broken career part of the story is that I'm an graphic designer who relies on the use of my hands to do my job. And now that my hand is still recovering I can't work or do anything and I'm concerned about what to do. I don't know who I should call, if there's some way of getting my expanses covered, what I'll do if I can't use my hand well enough in the future and I can't work as a graphic artist anymore. 

I'm surviving off the money I have saved and will be okay for about a month and I have medical insurance so that's all taken care of. But I just need advice of if I can get some sort of money to help pay for my expenses and what my options are. 

I don't really have the money to pay for a lawyer since al of my savings are paying for everything and I don't have a salaried job since I'm freelance at the moment.

"Military law: I was erroneously administratively discharged from the US Marine Corps for failing a urinalysis.. The title pretty much sums up my situation. Around two years ago I was notified that I had failed a urinalysis for d-amphetamine (adderall) and that, after 10 years of service, I was going to be processed for an administrative discharge, essentially firing me from my job without judicial proceedings and removing all benefits that I had earned. 
I was obviously in shock and, after speaking to my wife, hired a private attorney in addition to my military appointed JAG lawyer. He had an interesting proposal. He intended to have my urine specimen sent to a lab on the east coast for DNA testing. The results came back a few weeks later and the lab had successfully obtained a DNA profile which did not match mine. I was elated, and thought everything was in the past. 

My command pulled all proceedings and told my attorney they were going to commence an internal investigation as to what may have happened. They fired the Marine in charge of the urinalysis collecting program. 

About one year after all of this I received a call to report to my Battalion Sergeant Major. I had no idea why, and when I got to his office quickly found out that they were proceeding with the discharge anyway. They wouldn't tell me why. And now here I am, jobless and with a wife and 12 month old son, with no insurance or solid source of income. 

My question is this: Obviously, I still have all documentation showing the DNA results. Is there any recourse I could take? Would it be advisable to go to the media? Should I contact congressman? I am at a loss here. I apologized for the rambling and very much appreciate anyone that had some solid advice.",0
"Landlord/Tenant Situation (VA). My SO and I have been renting a home in Fairfax County since 8/1/16. The lease expires on 7/31/17 at 5pm. The landlord reached out asking if we intended to renew the lease in mid June and told is then that trhe rent would be increasing. At that point, we considered not renewing the lease as we do wish to buy a home in the near future. We asked the landlord if she would consider month to month or a shorter lease term (90 days) and she said no. We asked if we could have until 6/30 to think it over and she said no, she needed an answer within 3 days. After discussing we decided we'd sign the new lease and plan to start the home buying process next year, instead. We let the landlord know that we would renew the lease. She said she'd get the new lease to us within a week. 

On 7/5, well after the week she promised, she brought the new lease to us. It included an addendum that was not in the previous lease saying that after 1/15/2018, if she decides to sell the property, she can do so and give us 60 days notice to terminate the lease. The lease indicates that we have no ability to terminate the lease ourselves. We have not yet signed the lease. We have asked her to change the addendum to allow us the same flexibility to break the lease after 1/15/2017 and are awaiting her response. 

My questions are:

1. If we decide at this point to not sign the lease, must we vacate the property on 7/31/17? If not, what happens? The image is the part of the lease pertinent to the terms but I am still unclear what exactly it means. 

2. Does the fact that she did not give us enough notice about the changes to the lease give us any standing to demand more time to find a new place?

"[TN/TX] Got an emergency room bill from Honduras 4 months after visiting it. **Backstory**
My wife and I went to visit a friend in Roatan, Honduras in April.  I had to be taken to the emergency room for food poisoning.  While I was getting my stomach pumped, my wife was dealing with the paperwork.  They initially told her it would be $250.  After they saw that we had insurance it got bumped to a $500 ""deposit"",  and as we were ready to head out it turned into an $800 ""deposit"". At that point we were starting to get angry and told them to just charge us whatever the costs were.  We weren't just going to leave them money without seeing an invoice of the charges.  They refused to provide one.   

The dude had copies on his desk of my Driver's License and Insurance card.  So I grabbed them while he went and talked to his ""manager"".  When he came back we told him that we didn't want to use insurance and just charge us whatever the costs were.  My wife, being the great fighter that she is, got the ""deposit"" down to $500, cuz they kept on saying that they didn't know how much.  So we paid the ""deposit"" and I left them a copy of my driver's license and my email address.  

I don't want to scam these people, they might have saved my life, but I just wanted them to charge me for the services rendered.

Yesterday, almost 90 days out, I receive an email with the invoice of $5,000.  We spoke to our friend in Honduras and he says these charges are outrageous.  The invoice came from an American company.  

My question for a lawyer would be, is there a ""statute of limitations"" on this sort of thing?  Is there anything they can do to me legally?  All they have is my driver's license with an out of date address.

"[US] letter from debt collector, no previous notice and unknown debt. Up until last year I was a graduate student with federal student loans (no private loans) at a public university in Virginia. I had to take a leave for medical reasons, but finished all my classes and only have my thesis defense left. My last class was in Spring 2016 and I have not been registered since, but due to lack of enrollment began paying on my student debts in December 2016 after a 6 month grace period.

A few days ago I received a letter from a debt collector saying a debt has been placed with their office for collections. It states the original creditor is the university for $148.94, and there are about $150 in additional fees listed from them. It's dated June 26, 2017 and says I have 30 days to dispute in writing and gives a PO box address and phone number. 

I have no idea what the debt is from and there's been no attempt to collect before now. I did move 2 months ago but have a change of address filed. I logged on to my old university account to check if a fee was added later that I may have missed but it shows my history of payments and it's all balanced at $0. I'm totally willing to pay the $148.94 if it's a real debt I owe, but I have no idea what's it's for. I would rather not pay the extra $150 in collection fees and especially don't want a hit on my credit. 

Is there a way to check if it's real, and if so, what it's charged for? My university financial aid office is notoriously terrible over the phone and I'm no longer in that city to stop by in person. I want to dispute it but I don't know how to prove I send a letter in to the debt collector by writing to their PO box. I'm assuming a phone call would not be enough proof of dispute in time.",0
"NYC slumlord landlord issues. I've been living in my current building for two years and In the last five months the building has become infested with roaches, there are violent drug addicts that live in the building that have punched holes in the walls and puked all over the hallways, many people don't have working keys to their own apartments and the landlord hasn't done anything despite months of pleading with him. Beyond that, it's a six unit three story row house and 2/3 bedrooms don't have access to the fire escape because the middle windowless room has the second exit boarded up. 

Yesterday my apartment was broken into and what estimates at $4000 worth of my belongings and cash were stolen. My neighbors bike was also stolen. I was at the beach celebrating my birthday and my landlord told me it's my fault I was robbed because I was not home. He was in my kitchen yesterday fixing a problem (after four months of begging him to do it) and he told me he saw my door open even though he knew I wasn't home. I suspect him of course, but I truly don't think he's THAT shady, but I suspect one of the shoddy shady as fuck people he hired to ""fix"" the problems did. The cops busted our door down a month ago and the man he sent to fix the doorframe did it so badly that you have to practically bodyslam the front door to actually lock it. 

Due to the very illegal situation here and the fact that two tenets haven't paid rent in half a year everybody in the building has banded together and agreed to stop paying rent (we are all 25-30 years old with no kids and the ability to pick up and move but now we all have to save money to actually do it).

"How can I talk to the judge during my sentencing? Please help!. Hi guys, any help would really be appreciated.

-I have no criminal record, no priors
-I was far away from anyone else, camping, when I was detained
-I have 11 very-well written letters of reference

Basically, my boyfriend and I are looking at places to live. We found somewhere on Craigslist that is being rented. To be somewhat vague, he and I emailed the husband and wife. They responded saying that they are in Africa ""running an organisation"" doing religious stuff, i'm not sure. They basically said their previous property manager wasn't working out, so they decided to rent it out on their own.

Next thing they said in the email is that the documents and keys are with them and they can send the keys, which would take 16 hours FedEx, after receiving a deposit  and they will refund the deposit if we do not like the inside and do not want to live there. (Also included application questions, basic stuff, no confidential information asked for)

They provided an international phone number and said we could call if we have questions and they would call if we weren't able to call them. I had them call me and earlier in the day the phone call came from a number that said ""Russia"", but then later when I was able to answer, it was the number they provided in the email and caller ID thing said it was from Africa. 

I asked my questions and ended by asking if there is any way to identify them just to make sure it is legitimate and he said there is no one local here to identify them. I told him we want to drive by and look at it tomorrow and he said we could email him afterward.

It was established verbally that her father has seen her every other weekend and paying 500$ a month for child support. For years and years he never really paid consistent child support or was there emotionally there for her. We have done completely everything and she is everything to us. In the  past 6 months he has paid 200$ of child support so he told us about his financial troubles about his car getting reposed and he asked me to adopt his child. I knew this was an easy way for him to get out of child support but I didn't hesitate to look it the process of adoption, but 2 weeks later he changed his mind. We decided to submit to the state that we would like to establish child support so he has to pay through the state. It seems like since he found out about this he has now served us papers so he can have split custody. I work on base and am going to talk to the JAG and hire an attorney, because we don't want to risk anything. We have text messages talking about the adoption, to his financial troubles.

"(Ohio). Hit a pothole on an interstate causing a blowout. $618 dollars later, and I would like to seek repayment from the State. How?. PREFACE - I am in Ohio. The I-70 incident occurred in Columbus, and the I-75 incident occurred in Cincinnati.

Ill start from the beginning to lay out all the facts. Thank you in advance for reading.

Feb '17 - I hit a large pothole in a construction zone on I-70, causing a sidewall bubble on my front right.

May '17 - I learn of ODOT claims, and filed a damage report. They defer me to the construction contractor who, for all intents and purposes, laughs at me. I am out +$100 for an alignment and now have a sidewall bubble.

July '17 - I hit another massive pothole on I-75 which blows my right front tire. I make it to a tire shop, and paid $618 for 2 new front tires and an alignment.

Today - I have filed another ODOT damage report, and attempted to file a claim but realized I was in over my head.

**I am looking for some advice on how to move forward. Here are my questions:**

What are my chances of repayment? This is the 2nd time in 2017 an ODOT liable interstate caused damage to my car.

What else can I do to accomplish repayment? Does this involve a claim?

Since my car did not need to be towed, and there was no police contact, there is little official documentation of the incident. Will they believe me?

I drive a performance car which has all wheel drive. This stipulates that all four tread depths must be similar. Now, my front 2 tires are new and my back two are 1 year old. I did not have the money to cover all 4 tires when replacing, so I did what I could. Since my car requires all four tires to have similar tread, is it reasonable to claim that the state pay for all four tires?

"[US] Previously deported for illegal immigration, possible to re-enter legally as a tourist?. Some clarification and backstory: I am asking on behalf of a family friend who isn't technologically-savvy enough to know about reddit. He has a daughter who will soon graduate from college in the US, who does not know that he was once deported - and he wants to keep it that way if possible. Also, first post here, not sure about the rules, the whole nine yards - will edit accordingly if I've broken any posting rules.

Story:
My family friend (Bob) was an illegal immigrant for about a decade or so, until the mid-90s. He went there on a tourist visa and illegally extended his stay. In the mid-90s, Bob returned to his home country to settle some family affairs, and was detained when he attempted to return. From what I understand, he was flagged by the system upon arrival at customs, and it also didn't help that he had less than $100 on him (apparently, it seems that it signals an intent to stay illegally). Bob's visa was revoked and he was sent home on the next flight.

When his daughter was starting college, Bob tried to apply for a tourist visa to visit with her, and help her settle in. But the American embassy still had his records, and denied him his tourist visa.

Now, Bob is in the process of changing citizenships to another country on America's Visa Waiver Program (legally; his wife and daughter are from said country and he has been living and working in since being deported). If he successfully changes his citizenship, would it be possible for him to legally visit the US again? Or are there any other possible (non-illegal) workarounds to allow him to visit? He no longer has any intention of being an illegal immigrant.

"[WA] Fast food employee concerned about break requirements. So I work for a fast food restaurant (franchised, locally owned) and I have some concerns about what the owner allows for breaks. Here are some [screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/c40EX) of the state labor law site that say a 10 min break for 4 hours and a 30 min break for 5+ hours. My employer schedules me regularly for 5pm-close shifts (closing is at 10pm) but closing takes an hour or more. Since I am only /scheduled/ for 5 hours, I am given one 15 minute paid break at the 1.5 hour mark or close to then. Should I be getting more?

Also, sometimes I work a 3pm-close shift (8 hours including closing) and get either two 15 min breaks or one 30 min break (either the second break is unpaid or half of the 30 min break is unpaid). Is this legal?

The owner owns two of these places in town, and at the other one all breaks are unpaid and closing takes until at least 11:30pm. Is this bad/worse or is it considered the same?

On a side note, a (17 year old) coworker was recently ""encouraged to quit"" after working there since she was 15 for pointing out the child labor laws (see screenshot album). She would work 5pm-close shifts (more than the 3 hours max for 14-15 year olds and the 4 hours max for 16-17 year olds) on school days and 8 hour shifts on weekends and summers. She also got the same break schedule as the rest of us even though, as a minor, she should be getting more.

I was stopped in the bike lane while she crossed, and as she was about halfway across the bicyclist hit me in the rear. He immediately said that I hit him, but I don't think that's in dispute since the lady crossing gave a statement that she saw me wave her across and I was stopped when the guy hit me. He got up and walked to the side walk but said his shoulder was hurting. He thinks he hurt his clavicle, but refused an ambulance trip to the ER.

Cops came and took statements, they gave me a ticket for failing to yield the right of way to the cyclist. I am going to fight it in court because I feel I was yielding the right of way to the pedestrian. I also feel that since the guy hit me when I was stopped, he should be at fault for not stopping or avoiding me as I think there was enough time (he hit me in the rear, not the side, so I didnt cut him off with no chance to react). Is there grounds to fight the ticket? If the insurance companies get involved and he tried to sue me for damages, am I already going to be liable since the cops gave me a ticket? Any advice welcome.",0
"Two month notice to end tenancy, but landlord is making offers? Not sure what to do. [Surrey, BC, Canada]. Hey reddit, hopefully you can give me some advice because I'm feeling very overwhelmed by this whole situation...

My landlord has been texting me (our usual method of communication) saying she has been considering selling the condo we currently rent and she is going to have a realtor look at the place to see the value in the property. This is on July 5, 2017. 

On July 10, 2017 my landlord calls me and confirms that they will be selling the property. This is where the shady portion comes in...
She wants us to move out ASAP, August 1. She told me that ""she knows the laws"" and will honour a free month if she has to. But she will not give our damage deposit back if we choose to go this route. Can she do this? I feel very pressured to move out early but I don't want to move in the first place, I walk to work and I love the neighbourhood, is there any possibility that I can stress to let us keep the place? I'm having lots of difficulty finding new housing in the same area.

Also, she has not given me any official notice. When asking her to clarify the dates as tenancy is usually 1st/15th of the month, she refuses to do so. Shes instructed me to ask the realtor for specifics. When I look at the residential tenancy act on the BC Gov website it states to have the landlord be clear. 

I was recently promoted and am working a totally new job so I feel very overwhelmed on what to do. I appreciate any advice I can get. Thank you for reading...


[TL;DR - Landlord gave two month notice, won't clarify if its Sept 1st or 15th even though notice was through phone call July 10th. Landlord is also threatening damage deposit if we don't leave early Aug 1st/Aug 15th]",1
"Interest of conflict clause in a contract. Hello Everyone,

I got a new contract for a job in UK, everything seems fine except one clause which I think is very vaguely defined.

&gt;During your employment you will not be employed, engaged, &gt;interested or concerned in any activity, office or outside business &gt;interests (whether paid or unpaid) without the written consent of &gt;the Executive Management team.  
&gt;You will disclose in writing to the Executive Management team &gt;any such activities, offices or outside business interests you may &gt;currently have and in the event that the Executive Management &gt;team requires you to cease the same, you will do so forthwith.  &gt;For the avoidance of doubt consent will not be given in relation &gt;to any activities, offices or business interests which in the view of &gt;the Executive Management team, are similar to, or compete &gt;directly or indirectly with the business of the Company or which &gt;could in the view of the Executive Management team, give rise to &gt;a conflict of interest or interfere with the efficient performance of &gt;your duties.  However, such consent will not be unreasonably &gt;withheld.


As far as I understand if I haven't misunderstood it. They potentially can forbid me to do any sort of work, even volunteering for example for a local shelter.

Anyway, my main issue is that I already own a business which is in a completely unrelated field to the employment, hence I'm concerned.

I was wondering what do you gents/gals think about this clause, and would modifying the first sentence with something like this would help?

&gt;that may harm the interests of the Company, interfere with the &gt;Employee’s work time or to a not insubstantial extent occupy the &gt;Employee’s manpower.",0
"Disney dad want's split custody. Washington state. Hello!
My wife and I have been married almost 1 year, but together for 5 years. We have had our 6 year old living with us since she was 1. It was established verbally that her father has seen her every other weekend and paying 500$ a month for child support. For years and years he never really paid consistent child support or was there emotionally there for her. We have done completely everything and she is everything to us. In the past 6 months he has paid 200$ of child support so he told us about his financial troubles about his car getting reposed and he asked me to adopt his child. I knew this was an easy way for him to get out of child support but I didn't hesitate to look it the process of adoption, but 2 weeks later he changed his mind. We decided to submit to the state that we would like to establish child support so he has to pay through the state. It seems like since he found out about this he has now served us papers so he can have split custody. I work on base and am going to talk to the JAG and hire an attorney, because we don't want to risk anything. We have text messages talking about the adoption, to his financial troubles.

"[Ontario, Canada] Parents are in a very big business legal predicament.. So my parents started a business in a partnership along with another ""Friend"". Mainly a school and they would rent the halls out when not in use by the school. What happened was that they were demanding that my parents come to the school and stay there for the entire day and night (9:00am to 10:00pm) even though this wasn't something that my parents could do, seeing as they have their own lives to get to, along with some Power issues over the leadership of the company(It was my Parents and another couple, who were good friends, and at the same time they asked my Parents to stay the whole entire day, the Lady in the couple yelled out ""I will not be taking orders from this woman!"" the woman in question was my mom. So they had declined and so the Partners had sent a resignation to us. 

We had accepted the resignation, as my parents didn't know any better(This was a lifelong dream for them, so if they got that over with, they would have had full control over the school). And so immediately they had sent us multiple messages about amending the lease, which we would have done, except for the fact that they are keeping everything with them, and was refusing to give them to us (which are things like the Master Business license, and other things but I don't want to identify myself to them). The man in the other couple was representing us as our realtor, and he never gave us our lease agreement. We got it after contacting our landlord's agent for that. We also found out that the lady has gone against our resignation agreement, which told her not to represent the school in any way at all,through social media or in person, which she did. 

So is there anything we can do about this predicament?

"car repossessed incorrectly. I'm getting passed on and delayed by everyone I call or speak to. Any advice moving forward would be helpful.. relevant to australian law.

Long, exhausting series of events kept as short as possible.

My car was incorrectly repossessed. During the repossession the car was damaged (as per the marks in the road), I was belittled and insulted by the repo agent as well as the tow truck operator.

I was provided no documentation and no identification.

Upon calling the leasing company, they've said it was incorrectly repossessed. I've requested documentation regarding how and why this happened and they send me an email saying the vehicle can be picked up. 3 hours away in a different state.

I've called them again today and asked for a follow up - they've acknowledged they've received my email and I asked him to get me a response by the end of the day as it's now been a week i've been without transport.

He said hes not going to guarantee something he cant follow through on, as he's busy with other work.

I also asked for an update on the time taken to get the car back to me, they said i have to keep waiting or organise a truck myself.

So i call the company thats currently holding the vehicle, and they tell me they will call me back. 

In between all of this, i've been in touch with varying states of legal aid, and compensation aid and i've had no help - i get told to call someone else, who tells me to call someone else, who loops me back to the first person.

I'm frustrated, defeated and still carless. 

This has made a terrible impression at my new workplace and I'm fear of losing my job if im unable to keep asking friends and family for help getting to and from work. 

I'm backed into a corner and dont know what to do next. 

someone please help me.",0
"We are a non-married couple that is getting separated. We own a home together. What are my options? (Oregon). Sadly, my fiance and I of 10 years are getting separated. We have a wonderful 6 year old child and have owned a home together for 2 years. Due to her infidelity, staying together is no longer an option in our lives. We purchased a home in 2015 for approx. $275,000. The home is in a good neighborhood and the value has raised since the purchase. I believe it is now worth near $400,000 due to the crazy housing market of our city. Her wonderful father helped us out greatly in acquiring our home. He gave us $10,000 for a down payment and co-singed on the mortgage as well. He hasn't helped in any other way financially. We both appreciate everything he has done for us.

We both pretty much live paycheck to paycheck. Her and I have always split bills 50/50. I have 2 utilities in my name, she has 2 in hers. She generally handles the finances so the mortgage payment to the bank comes from her checking account. I pay her in cash every month for my share of the mortgage and we split all other things right down the middle. I would like to hope we both remain civil in this process, but there is no telling what will happen in the future. 

What are my options? I love living here, and I would hate to lose my house that I have worked so hard for. I kind of feel she is the one who should move out do to her infidelity, but that means little in court. I have very little money in the bank, and very few assets. What will happen if we decide to sell it? What will happen if we can not agree on who gets to remain living here? What if we decide to remain ""business partners"" and keep the house and rent it out? I am lost and confused and don't know my rights. Any advice would be much appreciated.",1
"College made numerous mistakes resulting in doubling my tuition. They took their time with everything until I passed the refund period and now I'm out at a few thousand.. I recently moved to a new state and decided I wanted to go back to college. I decided I would play around with the idea and I applied to a local state college since the application was free. They deemed me a resident (much to my surprise), so I decided I would go. Had I not gotten resident tuition, I would not have gone. I put my student loan things through and registered for Summer and Fall classes. Both my online application and written confirmation confirm that I was given in-state status.

Well, Summer classes roll around and my bill is for $4000 instead of $2000. I figured it was some early billing for Fall or something (they don't have an easy way to see an itemized bill) but I called to confirm after a couple weeks. Turns out someone made a mistake and I was actually considered out of state. They in no way contacted me to confirm this before I was given my bill. At this point, Summer classes have started. Eventually, I am told that they are working a way out for me to still get in-state tuition. I ask when I can see those changes reflected in my bill, and I get no response. It's been about a month and I haven't heard anything back from them despite my multiple attempts at contact. Now we have long passed the point where I can even get a partial refund and my bill still hasn't changed. I would have withdrawn immediately had I not been told repeatedly that everything would be okay. I have everything in writing and I'm wondering what all I can do. I've already taken out student loans for the year and I don't want to both change all my plans for the next year *and* go through the process of returning loans.",0

I'm 16 and receive a check once a month of I believe $700. The checks began to come in shortly after my mother died in 2010 and I've been told it's because my mom worked at Wal-Mart for a really long time but I've never actually seen this check because i guess my guardian set it so that goes to the bank instead of in the mail. Anyways, I would like to know how/what I'm getting this money for /  what it's called. My guardian has said that I'll keep getting this check as long as I stay in school and go to college, another time she said I would just get it until forever so i'm at a loss there.  Eventually I'm going to move out and I don't want to leave without my money because I have to live my own life. How old would I have to be to get this for myself, can I get it right after I turn 18 ? 

My mother also had (life insurance money I suppose?) split up for me and my older brother who has already taken his share. My part is in a bank account which again I've been told I can access once I'm older ( no one has access at all at the moment) but does that mean once I'm 18 or 21 or?

This post has gotten a little to long for my liking and I don't want to add anymore questions because I think I've had enough.

"[Illinois] Old apartment says I have 5 days to pay $600 for damages to apartment (paid non-refundable surety deposit but didn't receive an itemized list of damages). Sorry for the formatting, this is literally my first reddit post after creeping without an account for a long time. 

I lived in an apartment complex in the suburbs of Chicago for two years. While there, the only damages that I can truthfully say I have caused are the ripping out of a few vertical blinds **(you know, the ones that seem to fall out super easily with little prompting)**  and breaking the microwave handle. 

Needless to say, I expected to pay a small sum for the broken microwave handle. I was not, however, expecting $600!! I received the letter early June and was told I had till July 15th to pay all of it. I don't have that much to spare on short notice, and I wanted to wait a few weeks anyways to see the itemized list of damages. I never received one. Today, I called their office and alerted them of the fact I never received the itemized list i was supposed to receive (you know, to see what exactly I damaged). The woman who works in the office tells me that she sent one on June 15th, and offered to resend it. I'm sitting there thinking, ""if you really sent it, it must be here. no need"". I cannot for the life of me understand how I've received all my other mail at my forwarding address and this one seems to not have made it. At this point, what can I do? I won't have the money by then. If I received the itemized list on time, I could have disputed any false charges &amp; or simply talked to them. 
Also, I did pay $150 in a surety deposit (non-refundable). 
Can I refuse to pay until they can prove they sent me an itemized list? I would think the burden of proof lies on them, and not me.

"[TN] Involved in incident on highway where person at fault either lied about insurance or doesnt have any. Hey guys, so here's the deal: I was involved in an incident last week. I dont really want to call it an accident, but there is damage to my car. I was on the highway late night / early morning in extremely foggy conditions when I come up on a badly damaged car in the middle of the road with no lights on. Naturally I swerve to avoid hitting the car, but end up running over some of the debris from their accident. I pull over to assess damages to my car and don't notice any right away. I walk to the other car to see if there was anyone there (there was) and offer to drive them to the nearest gas station less than a minute away so they could report the accident (neither me nor them had a phone). As I'm about halfway home I hear an awful griding noise coming from under my car, I get home and check under and notice some damage to the tire rod housing.

I called the police to get information about the crash to give to my insurance and find out that the other party never called it in and didn't have a valid ID. I give them all the information I could and they call back a couple hours later stating that the other party was found and arrested and I can come get a crash report.

Now on this crash report, it states that the other party is from out of state, and has insurance. I called the insurance company listed and they say they have no policy that matches the number or name for the other party, which leads me to believe they either lied to the police about which company or they don't have any at all.

What are my options from here? I'm hesitant to file a claim with my own insurance for concern that my coverage will increase in price.

"Me (US citizen) looking to marry non-citizen boyfriend after his work visa application fell through. We're desperate and need help.. He was a student for 7 years at a university in TN, graduated in May, but then wanted to stay in the US. He had to file for OPT work or a work visa in that TIME to do so, but due to having an arrest on his record (that's now been expunged but took forever to pay off), the paperwork took too long to go through. His student visa is now expired by a day, and the immigration person at the university was on vacation this past week, and unfortunately, that was the last week that my boyfriend had any shot of getting the paperwork finalized. He had a meeting with this immigration person today, and he said there is nothing he could do, literally nothing. 

He was told that he has to go back to his home country of Trinidad no matter what. To get a work visa, he'd have to go back home for at least six months to get that paperwork situated there. 

Now, my boyfriend and I are looking at a green card marriage, but we have been together 2.5 years and have talked about being married anyway. It's not totally crazy as we do love each other. I have all of my documents, he has his (despite his license being expired). We're meeting with an immigration lawyer Friday. 

What I'm most nervous about is that I've been a nanny being paid under the table since March 2016.  I don't know if trying a green card marriage will hurt me by the IRS because I haven't worked the last 1.5 years according to them. And living long distance for at least six months would be awful, but being arrested or audited would obviously be the worst fucking case of this whole thing.

I asked him about this many times and he delflected the question and blame.
Later that year my older sister who had graduated was informed she had students loans taken out during her time (mind younshe was on the same set of grants as i) so i decided to dig around in my student information from my school, low and behold over 35k in student loans i never knew about. Or signed for. 


Is there legal action i can take to help this at all?
I the only reason i went to college to begin with was because I was told my grants/scholarship paid for everything.

Important note, my father has also commited various amounts of identity theft on myself, my mother and my sisters. Going so far as to take all the equity out of the house i grew up in and lose the house.

"Landlord refusing to return security. I moved into an apartment in CT back in May 2016 which turned out to be horrible due to no wall insulation and an unstable downstairs neighbor who moaned when I had females over for fun then smoked cigarettes and denied it and made me ill from second hand smoke. I later found out from a next door neighbor that the prior tenant living in my apartment abruptly left after a few months due to similar reasons to mine. Calls to management made no difference and they denied any smoking or problems with neighbor. They even went as far as threatening eviction for stating I was causing him a disturbance, refusing my calls about the eviction threat then stating it was sent by mistake by their Jewish lawyer during their holiday. Despite all of this, I received a lease renewal request in March 2017 and was too busy with work (I work in a hospital) to look for apartments or sign the renewal. Finally got to a point where my neighbor continued to smoke and then harass me with total denial by him and management and I decided to get the hell out. I found a nice but more expensive place and signed the lease renewal letter on June 1 as intent to vacate by July 1 which was received by them on June 8, 2017. I also left the apartment spotless and in better condition then when I moved in by leaving expensive blinds and newly painted walls. I have all letters, payments and the apartment condition documented with pictures. 

Now the management company is refusing to return any security because they are saying I did not supply 30 days notice. The apartment is spotless and they only commented on the timing of receiving the lease renewal notice. Does the timing of the renewal signing and 30 days notice have anything to do with receiving back my security? Can I take them to small claims court?",1
"[GERMANY] I committed forgery of a document. I'm from Germany and I committed forgery of a document. The original document is a paper that says that coorperation XY will hire me as a trainee (I know the owner of XY).

WHY:

My old employee pays for certain training programmes, to enable me to get employed again. Basically, I prove to my old employer, that I could get employed at coorperation XY, BUT I'm missing driver license for this specific kind of vehicle, so he pays for the classes for my driver license that I need. When I send my old employed the original document, he said, an intern ship doesn't suffice, I have to get hired as workforce.

What I did:

The old document had about 200 words, which said they would hire me as an intern, but only if If I have this license. I changed so it now only says that they hire me (The person I talked to said if I leave all the ""intership"" mentionings out, it's ok and he'll pass the proposal). The document doesn't say what kind of work I will be doing.


I only faked the document because I need it as quick as possible and the owner of XY is currently in holidays.

I didn't use my brain, I know I made a grave mistake that won't happen again.

But what's the smartest to do right now? I have 2 options.

Talk to the person that will read the faked document tomorrow and tell him I sent him the wrong document. I will then go to cooperation XY, get  new document that will have the essential text, and send it to my old employer. But he will still have the old document that is faked, which proves I committed a crime, but what if I would say, that I mistakenly send the preview document, instead of the one that the company XY gave me.

Or just wait it out, hope that noone notices, having bad thoughts for days.

"Landlord liable for dangerous situation?. Jane (fake name) is an international student renting an attic in New Jersey (real state). There is a door at the base of the stairs. When you go up the stairs to the attic, there is the living space and a bare closet. The closet is not a regular closet, I guess the best way to describe it is if the attic is an upside down V, half of it has been carpeted for living space, and there's a wall with a door seperating the other half of the attic that contains the closet.

Jane was not informed not to use the closet. There is no sign. There is no lock on the closet. She stored some luggage and other items in the closet space. Today, while at work, Jane received a text from the landlord, claiming that Jane broke the Central AC by storing things in the attic. 2 of the landlord's text messages:

""The electrician and owner was at the house.  I took out luggage and stuff from the closet yesterday where unit is and he found two more suitcases and hangers.  This caused the air unit to break.  He fixed it but charged me $150.  Please include this charge with your rent check this Friday July 14 and please do not ever store anything else in there.  You can use the garage.""

""I am sorry Jane but I am not going to pay for it. I did not create it.  It was super dangerous to have stuff next to those cables too""

I feel like the landlord is completely in the wrong here. I think it is reasonable for Jane to assume she could use the closet as she was paying to rent the attic. Even the landlord called the space a closet in the text. What if a fire had broken out while Jane was sleeping?

Jane is willing to move out, but the landlord has the deposit. The repair bill is $150 so it's really not worth consulting an attorney. If the landlord is in the wrong, how can we approach this situation?",1
"[Florida] Officer at my door with papers twice today, what could they want?. Late Saturday night my downstairs neighbors called the police on my husband and I for arguing (the walls are thin here), we did not answer the door because the neighbors call the cops constantly over the most minor things like doing dishes, watching tv, walking around at night and so on, every time we HAVE answered the door in the past the officers simply tell us they got an anonymous complaint for noise, and that they couldn't hear anything, then they leave.  We stopped answering the door quite a while ago, because it's just an annoyance.  However when the police officers arrived Saturday night they MIGHT have heard my husband raising his voice, but we weren't in need of any sort of police assistance, it was just an argument, so we did not answer the door.

Anyway, today (Monday) I got a knock on my door in the morning while I was still in bed, then again at 6:00 PM, both times an officer not in uniform, but with a badge, had a clipboard with paperwork. The 2nd time I did try to answer the door but the officer was already leaving.

My question is this, what could they possibly want?  Could this be related to blatantly not answering the door on Saturday night over a noise complaint?  Or is this possibly a subpoena they are trying to serve on an unrelated case (last year someone attacked me and destroyed some of my property and he's still going through pre-trials)

Either way, I haven't gotten anything in the mail.  I'm just wondering what could be going on.  It's too late for me to call the district attorney's office to ask if this is about the court case I'm a victim in, and I'm scared it might not be about that and might be about that stupid argument my husband and I got into Saturday night....

"Commercial Neighbor is Stealing My Air Conditioning Though the Wall [FL]. I run a bar in a commercial building in the State of Florida.  My neighbor, who is also my landlord, has a massive bitcoin mining operation next door.  It is clearly written in our lease that he may not take any action that interferes with my ability to conduct my business.

About three weeks ago, he installed some massive exhaust fans to help with cooling his operation.  Ever since then, there has been noticeable suction in our property (most noticeable when opening a door).  The air conditioning is running constantly, and is not able to pull down to temp (July in FL doesn't help, but we've been open for over a year, and it has never been an issue before).  Our floor and sink drains are exhausting a terrible sewage smell.

We've had repeated conversations with the neighbor/landlord (and his employee who is his surrogate for landlord activities) about it, and he has basically told us to F off.  He says something like we should have sealed our space better (He built the walls between our space!  They were pre-existing!).

The only way we've found to alleviate the problem is to leave all of our doors open, but then it is miserably hot and bright in the space.  Otherwise, it smells like sewage.  This is really costing us customers.

I figure I can take him to court somehow.  But, what preparations should I make?  What evidence could I bring?  I can't think of a way to prove a smell, or prove loss of revenue.

Our plumber doesn't know what to do.  Our HVAC contractor doesn't know what to do.  I talked to a lawyer about it, but he basically said it didn't sound big enough for his time, and I should keep trying to find a way to resolve it with the landlord or file a suit on my own.  But the landlord isn't budging and we are losing customers.",1
"Do I have a discrimination/retaliation/wrongful termination suit?. I was fired from my job as a health inspector at a county government in Illinois. I was told it was because I was not performing to expectations. I was on a 6 month probationary period and at 5 1/2 months through it, and would not have protection from the union until 6 months. I am gay and was part of a harassment investigation against the director of the division, who is also the person who terminated me. 

I work very little with my bosses (the director and assistant director of the division), and instead work closely with senior people who work as trainers. In the 5.5 months I received no formal performance review or corrective action. 

I was part of a harassment investigation, against the director of the division as I witnessed him say something sexist to another coworker. This was the second harassment investigation against the director. 

There were two other employees, a heterosexual female and heterosexual male, who finished the 6 month probationary period, but I know took longer to train based on responsibilities: They were not allowed to do certain inspections or responsibilities until 5-7 months after hire, where I was allowed to do them at 4 months from hire. 

Every single person who trained me has said that I have been performing at or above expectations and better than the two other recent hires. 

The other employees, who encouraged me to do this, have said I was fired because the director did not like gay men (or women). 

Do I have a case for retaliation since I was fired being part of a harassment investigation? Do I have a case for wrongful termination since there was little to no documentation about corrective action and heterosexual employees, who performed worse than me were retained. 

If I do have a case, what do I do next?",0
"[FL] Are there grounds for termination of a lease if repairs are not made to the unit, and the lease has not been signed by the manager of the apartment property?. My girlfriend and I moved into our new place last weekend, and we had the movers before we had the key.  It was agreed between all parties that the unit would be suitable for move-in on 7/7.  When we obtained the key, we immediately realized that the entire apartment smelled of smoke, the hardwood floors were covered with dirt, the carpet was filthy, the dishwasher was falling out of the carpentry, there was rat feces behind the fridge and on the back of the fridge, the bathroom sink was broken, there was mold on the ceiling of the living room and bathroom, and the piping for the tub needed to be replaced (this was not found out until the next day).

Since we were in a hurry, we did not get a copy of our lease.  And since the movers had arrived and were being paid by the hour, we started moving items into a dirty apartment.  When we went into the office, we are told that we cannot look at any lease until the Apartment Manager returns from vacation (next tuesday).  This is our first issue about the situation.

A plumber came last night and opened the walls to see that there was a non-lethal methane leak that was taking place and that the pipes from the top down needed to be replaced.  The lady quoted the maintenance guy for $500, and the leasing office refused to pay the amount; they stated that they could fix it themselves.

We went up to the office within 3 days after moving in to request to terminate the lease and the lady behind the counter chuckled at my girlfriend and replied with a sarcastic, ""mmmkay"".  

I realize that we made some serious poor decisions, but I want to know what my best moves would be here.  Thank you in advance for your assistance.",1
"[CONTINUED][NY] I moved out, she made insults. Should I pay what she's asking?. I finally moved out from the apartment and all my belongings were safe and sound. Before the move out period, however, she made some insults and neglected her duty of keeping the common place clean. She owns a cat and I am seriously allergic to any fur animals, which caused some heavy medical problems for me.

She's asking me about $500 for the extra week's stay, $150 for the labor for installation, and electricity bill that came when she said that previous one was the last one I had to pay, which I already did. I already paid for the door cost and the whole transportation for the door (Uber from Home Depot to the apartment). I was going to pay for all these originally, but with the insults that she made and the fact that she hasn't even apologized makes me not want to pay for any of additional charges that she's asking.

Now, none of these were written on the paper and I don't think I am legally required to make these payments. She still hasn't apologized and what not. Should I just move on with my life and not pay her a cent? Will I be in any legal troubles for not paying? My lease ended 7 days before I moved out as well so the additional stay is not included in the lease either.
She originally tried to rip me off by adding personal purchases onto the recipt and overcharging the whole cost and now she's down to all minimums.
For the whole door fiasco, she went from $500 to $300 when she knew I wasn't going to pay for her ridiculously overpriced service. She tried to include uber trips that weren't discussed before into the bill that I had to pay as well etc. Keep in mind that each uber costs were all $77 plus...

"Some huge family issues going on and need advice.. Okay, so there's this huge conflict breaking our family apart right now, a lot of information is being thrown and I have remained neutral through all this. 
So a few days ago my cousin, let's call him Joe. Joe started sending the female cousins sexually explicit text messages (not too sure of the content, but they've all said it's dirty, inappropriate, and flirty. Joe is I'm his 30s married for 10 years with 2 kids. All of the female cousins are over 18, and we live in Illinois, the United States. Joe also helped the eldest female cousin involved, we'll call her Sally, by helping her with her résumé. She sees the résumé being bait for starting to message her. The messages went on for a few days and even spread to other female cousins. Yesterday, Joe came on to the Family Whatsapp group chat and said his phone/account was hacked and to disregard any messages accordingly. His phone passcode is pretty easy and doesn't do 2-step verification. Joe and his wife left the group chat shortly and blocked a lot of people on social medias. Soon after another cousin, ""Simon"", said he was ready to kill someone, and me not knowing about the situation yet thought he was joking. So I commented, he then said now is not the time implying he was serious. Simon has a firearms license, but doesn't own any of his own (that I know of). He lives with his parents still. This morning, a few sentences were said that especially needed legal backing:

""The police can't get involved, everyone is over 18 so there won't be a case""

""Whatsapp encrypts all their data, if the government can't get in, a hacker can't""

Is there anything I can do to clarify anything? Especially those last 2 sentences were especially peculiar. Please help by any means. Thank you. I will answer any extra questions needed.",0
"Intern not being paid for overtime worked. Is this legal?. Location: I do not want to get too specific because it will identify me. If there are major laws that apply to this that are state specific please let me know. 





Background: I am a software engineering intern at a major ""non-tech"" company. I was told at orientation that interns were not allowed to work overtime- but that if we went over a bit we would be compensated for it and it wasn't too big of a deal. I have been working here for several weeks now and every pay cycle I have received a bit of overtime- nothing major. Maybe an hour or 2. 





This pay cycle I was supposed to receive 2.5 hours of over time- the reason being that I was unable to leave work at an earlier time so I went over 40 hours. Instead of sitting and doing nothing until I can leave I continued to work. I found out that the online time sheet i fill out was manually adjusted to remove ALL overtime I have worked this pay cycle. I was told this is because ""interns are not allowed to work over time"" but nothing I signed through employment seems to indicate that. I did a quick run through all the documents I signed ctrl + f for terms like ""intern"", ""overtime"" and nothing came up. 




I am absolutely furious that I ended up wasting time at work that I will not be compensated for. What are my rights? Since I am an intern I don't think I can afford a lawyer (and a company this big surely has some pretty decent lawyers I'd assume). I just don't know where to go from here on out. 




For what its worth- this company has had controversy over overtime pay in the past which I found through some googling. I don't want to allow myself to be treated unfairly just because I am an intern. Any advice? 



In case it isn't clear: I am an hourly intern unlike most of the full time employees who are salaried.",0
"[NC] Former owner of laptop will not cooperate with removing management software. Options?. Hello,
 
I graduated High School this past summer, and bought my macbook from the school. The guarantee was that once the laptop was fully paid for, the school technology department would remove unnamed management software. I don't know if it is a keylogger, website monitoring software, or what additional restrictions exist. I know that I can not change my energy settings nor control my security and privacy options.

After I paid the school the full balance, the software was not removed. I emailed the technology department requesting removal and received a preliminary response days later stating the the lead for such matters had previously been on vacation, despite not having turned on any sort of automatic reply indicator.

I am currently overseas, and have limited wifi options. I requested that the technology department give me a timeslot that they needed me to connect to the internet within. I told them that I would make whatever time they gave work.

In response, I was told that they were unable to give me a time slot, but that it just had to be connected for a short period of time. I further emailed and explained that I was unable to just randomly have it on, as my time zone is multiple hours ahead and wifi is very limited in the city where I live, so I needed them to provide a time that worked for them, and I would cooperate with whatever time they set.

Since then, I have not received a single reply despite nearly 3 business days elapsing.

I understand that this issue may seem minor, but I bank off my computer, and am soon going to be hoping to use it for purposes of a more sensitive nature where I am legally unable to have outer management software installed on my device.

"Large retailer refusing to honor sale price. Is this against the law?. Hello,

A large US based retailer is not honoring the sale price for 2 suits that was advertised on their website. Just an fyi I am located in Canada and they operate here as well (online store and brick &amp; mortar stores).  I’ve spoken to three different reps before hand who assured me the price would be honored. They said I would get refunded the difference in about 1-2 weeks. It was close to 2 weeks after my purchase and I didn’t receive any refunds so I called back and they said they wouldn’t be able to honor the price anymore. I’ve complained countless times and management finally said they can honor both suits (They were very reluctant and made it difficult for me, they even closed my case without notice). 

Again about a month has passed and I still didn’t receive my full refund balance. Now after reaching out to management, they are saying they can only honor the one suit even after providing screenshots of the product listing with the sale price. 

Is this against the law? In Canada we have a law should cover this (http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/00522.html#sale) and I believe this falls into this category. The sale price was still on the website 2 days after I made my purchase and they didn’t resolve the issue with me right away (I had to reach out to them to find out) and is still on going after more than 2 months. 

Secondly, I was charged a large amount of taxes and duties on the original price I paid but since I’m paying the sale price, shouldn’t I get refunded the difference in the duties/taxes fees? Again they are refusing to reimburse me for those fees that were charged.

I’m not sure how much of a case I have but would love to hear your thoughts and if you have any suggestions. Much appreciated!",0
"[CA] AC broke in the house I'm renting and landlord is dodging our phone calls. A little bit of a back story:
Me and my roommates moved into our rental house in September of 2016, upon moving in we noticed a lot of stuff wrong with the house that we didn't previously take notice. For instance, writings on the bedroom walls, no screens for the windows, holes in closets and old dog shit in the corners of the closets as well. We initially took notice of the badly stained carpet and requested they get them cleaned. We originally had to pay the carpet cleaners and it was a hassle getting our money back from the landlords because they said we chose an expensive carpet cleaner (but they approved the company we hired to do the carpet). These are just a few things we struggled with upon moving in. The house looks 10x nicer than it did before we moved in, with money straight from our pockets. When we first moved in the AC was broken so they had to get someone out to fix it, all was fine until last Thursday when the AC broke again and our tech guy said it was a leak, most likely the AC unit needs to be replaced, which would cost thousands of dollars.The AC is in our contract, it took us 3 days to finally get a hold of our landlord to tell them the house is 99 degrees and we need someone to check the AC ASAP. They haven't ""approved"" someone yet to come out and take a look at it. We know this is going to be a hassle with them because they are cheap and they honestly don't give a shit, they only care that we pay them (which we've always paid on time) we're now considering moving because dealing with them is hell. Basically, I want to know what legal rights we have here? Wouldn't this be a breach of contract ? It's 106 today and our house reads 100 inside, we stayed in a hotel last night because fans weren't doing justice anymore. Any advice helps",1
"Help with predatory roofing company. Please.. Hail damage earlier this year to my home and numerous others in my neighborhood. Company was doing estimate on my neighbor so wife and I let him inspect ours. I, unfortunately, signed a contract with him that says if the insurance company approves the claim, I am to hand the check to this roofer and they will do the work. No money out of my pocket. 

Problem 1 - I signed the contract but the insurance check is in my wifes name and the house is in both of our names. 

Problem 2 - contract is so vague with zero pricing. Everything is TBD with no description of the roofing system other than asphalt 3-tab shingles TBD and GAF.

Problem 3 - My deductible was nearly $7,000 which left me with only $5000 to do a $10,000 roof replacement - minus provided funds to fix some gutters, vents, and facia boards. 

Problem 4 - When I did try to reach this guy for additional information, he is very elusive and provides very little information other than threatening me with a lawsuit if I cancel this contract and is trying to extort a cancellation fee of $1,000 or if he goes to his lawyer, he's going to sue me for 25% of the total cost my insurance company paid me for replacement. Ugh. And I've not done any work to the roof because I am poor with over $1M, yes, $1 MILLION DOLARS in medical debt. I requested quotes from 5 other vendors doing roofs in my neighborhood and this guy was last in price, professionalism, and just overall ability to make me feel like this $10,00 investment would be a sound installation I could live with.

I can go on and on about this guys professionalism and lack of customer experience but I'll be damned if I'm letting this company put a roof on my house at this point. It's only asking for trouble as I've had a previous home with roof issues after a replacement. 

Anything I can do?",1
"Was promoted but not getting paid for it.. Hey everyone, I was hired on to work for an afterschool program at a local school. When I was originally hired on, I was going to be a coordinator that would be paid $12.00 an hour and start in the summer. 

However, before I actually started, we found out the Assistant Manager was going to be gone for the summer. I was then told that I would be promoted to Assistant Manager for the summer. With this job, the base pay is usually $14.00, but with my experience I could expect around $14.50-15.00. 

So, we started on 6/15, and I've been working full time as Assistant Manager. The entire time my supervisor has been emailing/calling/texting her boss to get her to update my pay to Assistant Manager. She didn't for the last paycheck, and I was under the assumption I would be getting retroactive pay for this paycheck. Today I found out that my pay had still not been updated, so I talked to my supervisor again, and she gave me her supervisor's (the person in charge of updating my pay) phone number and told me that I should text her myself to get her going. 

Well, I did. But she didn't text me back, instead she emailed my supervisor and told her that since the original Assistant Manager would be coming back after the summer, they couldn't give me the position, and that I would have to be paid the original $12.00 that I was originally offered. 

So, do I have any options? Is there any way I can get compensated for the pay I was expecting? Being the assistant manager is much more difficult than being a coordinator, so I would like higher compensation. My job role is completely different as well. I've pretty much taken on a massive amount more of responsibility and job difficulty on the expectation that I would be paid more for it, but after a month of working with that expectation I've found out that I'm not.",0
"[Los Angeles, CA, USA] About to start a tech job with a film studio, I write amateur scripts on the side. What precautions should I take to protect intellectual property that I create? [Entertainment Law, Intellectual Property]. Like everybody and their brother in this town, I too, am an aspiring screenwriter on the side.  I am about to start a tech job at one of the major studios, and in my offer letter it has the boilerplate stating that as of the day of my employment I assign any and all IP to them.  I don't really have any choice about signing this if I want to work there.  This job is not creative, but I could be exposed to creative projects at various stages of development.

I have developed to a reasonable degree one TV project (pilot written, season 1 outlined) and on film script (fully outlined with 20 pages of dialogue).  I've never really done much with either project other than have my friends read them.  I have no representation, nor am I a member of any trade union.

Obviously I'd love to have the film studio pick up either of these projects, but I don't want to have gifted these work (nor anything else that I create) to the film studio just because they've hired me as a code monkey.  What are my rights here?  

I know in CA that as far as tech is concerned as long as you don't develop the IP with the company's time or resources and it is not substantially related to their business you can own it.  Does the same thing apply to creative works?  Can I continue to create works on the side?  Obviously, I can't steal ideas from anything I get exposed to at the studio.  What precautions should I take to avoid any appearance that I've done so?

You can find a lot on Google advising independent creatives about sharing stuff with studios, but I don't see anything pertaining to individuals with an employment contract.  Thanks for reading.",0
"[PA] The police impounded my vehicle and won't release it to me... no charges have been filed. It's been a week.. Hi - I just created this account. I am hoping someone here can help me.

To make a long story short: the police allege I hit a telephone pole and then abandoned the vehicle on the side of the road. There was no collision with any other vehicle, nobody was injured, and there were no witnesses.  The police came to the scene, found my vehicle pulled off to the side of the road with the hazard lights on.  They waited about an hour, then had my vehicle towed - is what they told me.

Note: The vehicle is actually owned by my dad, but he gave me permission to drive it.

Anyway, the next day I called around and found out where my vehicle was towed.  I went there to pick it up, and the towing place said that the police have a 'hold' on it and that they aren't permitted to release it, unless the 'hold' is lifted.

I went to the police and asked them to release the hold, and they said they are investigating it.  I left.

Today, they called and said that they want to speak to my father (since he is the owner of the vehicle) in order to release it.  My father called and asked if he comes in, will they release it. The police said no, because they still have to do investigating.

I was not charged with anything, nor was my father. This happened last week.  As far as I know, the police are saying that 'they have all of this evidence that I hit a telephone pole and committed a hit-and-run'. 

Can they keep my vehicle at the tow yard without a search warrant and without having pressed charges? It seems extremely unfair, especially since I am accumulating towing costs each day it sits there.

They won't release it, because they said the vehicle was 'abandoned'. Clearly it wasn't, provided that I called the next day to retrieve it.

Any advice?

"[MT] Water utility isn't providing water. **TL;DR** - I don't have water at home right now and am pissed at my water company. Any help is appreciated! 

Hello! This problem isn't related to just me, but my whole subdivision. We're not on city water but rather a small county water district (governed by parts 22 &amp; 23 [here](http://www.lccountymt.gov/cdp/special-districts/water-sewer-districts.html), but probably not much relevant). The district is then managed by another party. My story here is becoming a recurring event each summer.

We're subject to  odd-even watering restrictions in the summer with all lawn irrigation banned between 1000-1700. Last week on 3 July, they announced a total restriction on any outdoor water usage, noting ""Water has fallen near and often below the pump levels which will cause pump failure and inability to provide water to our residents.  To prevent catastrophic failure in the water system, it is imperitive that lawn watering cease until further notice."" This first restriction was lifted mid-day on 5 July while lengthening the no-watering period from 1000-2000 daily. Yesterday they restricted it further with no lawn irrigation between 0800-2000.

Now today we have an emergency total water shut off with no other news about how soon we'll have water or in what quantity. Which brings me to why I'm posting here. At what point do we not owe the utility our payment? They clearly haven't delivered water, and this is mostly restricted to our subdivision, not the whole county. The water management company has told us they've recommended the developers add another well and that doing so would alleviate most of these now-annual emergencies. I worry that the pumps have broken and they'll bill residents the cost of fixing them, despite ignoring the water management company. What resources do we have as consumers to fight back?",1
"Is it illegal to make a YouTube video in which I argue that a violent revolution would be ethical?. I want to make a video in which I argue that, *hypothetically speaking*, a violent revolution would be ethical. I don't want to go too much into the details of the argument, but the basic idea is that a violent revolution against a certain industry/practice (not the government per se) would be ethical because that industry/practice causes more harm and suffering than would be entailed in the revolution. In essence, my argument is that it would be ethical to resort to violence in this case because violence is already being done and the net effect of this revolution would be a decrease in violence. The primary example I use is that of abolitionist John Brown, whose violent revolution (though unsuccessful) many credit with setting off the chain of events that led to the American Civil War and thus the abolition of human slavery.

In the beginning of the video I plan to explicitly state that this is purely hypothetical and that I do not intend to commit any violence myself and I am not suggesting anyone else do the same.

Philosophers talk about this kind of stuff all the time. For example, Sam Harris has said that it's perfectly normal in a philosophy seminar to talk about whether it's ethical to kill and eat human babies, though no one actually has any intention of doing that.

IANAL (obviously) but I vaguely remember terms like ""incite a revolution,"" ""incite a riot,"" and ""advocate violence."" And then there was that American citizen (Anwar al-Awlaki) who got drone striked for making Youtube videos in which he advocated violence against the US. The difference here is that I'm speaking in purely hypothetical terms, not actually suggesting anyone commit violence.

"Roach infestation, management isn't doing ANYTHING.. So my lease clearly states that management is responsible for any pest control and extermination services.

Apparently they have their handyman (who's part of management but isn't a true ""handyman""), who is going around spraying apartments for their pest control.

I hit him at a stop sign, I have already admitted fault as I was putting on my hat assuming he was going forward and alas he wasn't.

The guy got out of the car and started yelling at me, calling me a stupid kid and called the cops immediately. I left a couple scuffs on his bumper with my licence plate screws. Basically damage that 75% of the people wouldn't care about, and 99% would just trade info, but this guy was fuming.

Now, I have a clean driving record (I'm 31 as well) and this is the first time cops were involved in any of my driving experience. The cop himself said this should have just been a trade of info, but the fuming man just wanted to see me burn. I held my tongue and just did everything necessary to get this over with and me back to work. The cop handed me a citation for speeding, and he told me the only reason it says speeding is because I was supposed to be going 0mph and to ""not worry about that"" in that situation and then he told me to go to the courthouse and say something very specific and basically the citation will be removed (I don't want to use his exact words here)

The damage is seriously very minor and I really don't need a ""speeding"" ticket on my record when I am in the business of driving so I would like to ask you guys if you know what he said to say, I'm sorry it's super vague but I assume it's something where they have to research the ticket.

She currently lives in a trailer on a trailer park which she pays rent. She's been here for about 15 years and the landlord has refused to fix things in the park for years. However, this newest refusal I consider to be out of line. My mom recently fainted and broke her foot (about 5 days ago) and this has basically immobilized her. A few days prior to her accident she called me telling me that the toilet and bathtub were broken. Basically when she flushes the toilet it backs up somewhere and in the piping and what she flushed begins to come out of the bathtubs drain. The bathtub itself doesn't want to properly drain. Her and her neighbor discovered a piece of land outside of her home that seemed to be leaking and spewing up sewer waste. They both called the landlord on multiple occasions leaving voicemails that he never returned. She finally got through to the landlord yesterday and told him what was happening. He told her that he'll get to it and she described her injury. Once she told him this he replied by telling her to go to the bathrooms at supermarkets. She replied by telling him again about her broken foot, how she's been using a portable toilet in her living room, and that there was nowhere for her to dispose of the waste. His follow up to her response was to take the portable toilet outside and throw the waste into the vacant lot next to her trailer.

So my partner and I have bought a street front block which was one of the three lots subdivided from an original corner block. It's 324m2 and in an old residential area. 
We were not told when purchasing the block that the water mains for the street runs through the verge and would need to be lowered to allow for a crossover to be added to the block once construction was complete. We actually found out about this when a bobcat drove over it and burst it because it was only buried by 10cm of sand.
We aren't able to increase the level of the verge because it would make the driveway far too steep so our only option is to pay to have the mains dropped. The estimated cost is $5000, although they can charge more once works are completed if necessary. 
This is obviously a huge financial blow for us. This is our first home and we really don't want to sink our savings for furniture, fencing, landscaping etc into this pipe. 
We know that when the conditions for subdivision were given to the land owner there was no mention of the water pipe so even though they probably should have mentioned something when we bought it, I don't think there is anything we can do about that.
My question is, is the water corporation at fault for not recommending to the land developer that the pipe had to be lowered. My understanding of subdivision approval is to ensure all lots are able to be built on and ours currently can't. So many people I've spoken to have said they believe the water corp is at fault for not making this a condition of approval but the water corp of course admits no fault and just wants us to pay.
Does anyone know anything about property law? If it's any help, I'm in Western Australia. 
Thanks in advance.",1
"A business that I owe money to came on to my property to my back door and tried to knock. Is this not illegal? Do I need to put up a sign?. My husband and roommate both work together overnight. Over the summer my children have been going to bed a little late, so they can see more of him in the evenings while they are on summer vacation. I have a screened in porch to my front door that I have been locking during the day lately, so that no one can come in and ring the bell and wake everyone up as we've been sleeping until about noon. 

A business I owe money to and have every intention of paying when I have the means to...came to my home and obviously tried to open the front lanai porch. Finding it locked, he went around to the back of my house and entered my lanai to knock on my slider door.  There is no walkway to get to the back and no one uses the back door of people's homes here in Florida. It's obviously a private lanai and what I consider an outdoor, but private space of my home. I know some homes in other areas have a second door that would be acceptable to use by a stranger, but this is not the case here. I wouldn't think of going around to the back of someone's property let alone entering their lanai. 

I didn't hear if he knocked on the front door my bedroom door was shut. What did wake me up was him knocking on my lanai and startling me awake. He was leaving as I was looking to see who it was,  but he left a note in the slider. The back lanai door is broken and doesn't shut properly without slamming it which my kids don't always do so it was ajar and unlocked. 

My question is it not illegal for him to go to the back of my property an enter a private screened in area? Yes I owe the business money, but I don't see how they have the right to do that? Should I put up a sign? What should I say to the man if he comes back about the situation? Thank you",0
"Our old management agency refunded only 1/8 of our original security deposit. Okay, so my roommates and I live in a college town and all the management agencies are notorious for screwing over college students. Go figure. Recently we moved out of our duplex and have been waiting to hear back about our refundable security deposit. Originally, our deposit was $1600. After moving out we were informed that our deposit refund is a whopping $200. I checked the ledger and it accounts for cleaning fees and maintenance, which we expected. However, there was a steep ""invoice fee"" of $700. This just seems asinine to my roommates and me. Is there any way we can fight this? We are all fulfilling the odyssey of broke college students and could really use some help here. As a side note, we put up with a multitude of issues as tenants. For example, we had our garage flood due to blocked sewage drains and a clogged grate in front of our garage door. We lost many items that were stored in our garage and invested our money in sandbags and a shop vacuum to clean up the mess. Only after the second flood and a multitude of phone calls did our management agency respond to the flooding. Additionally, only after a slew of emails and phone calls did we get reimbursed a measly $60 for our out of pocket expenses of nearly $160 trying to fix the flooding. Also upon moving in, the unit was uncleaned, the water heater was broken, the ceiling had depressions from water leaking, our kitchen sink was leaking, and were told by the maintenance crew we would receive new room doors eventually (which never happened). Only a few of the aforementioned issues were addressed during our lease. I don't want to threaten our management company with this. Although, maybe this can be used as leverage? Does anyone out there have any suggestions or are we SOL?  Thanks a ton. This is in Washington by the way.",1
"Unsanitary working conditions. TL;DR: The place I work is gross, and the manager does nothing to prevent it. What do I do?

I work at a local pizza restaurant, and the manager is just awful. I could go on about it, but here's the main concern: I'm pretty sure I got a fungal infection from working with dishes. The area rarely gets cleaned properly (I'm one of the maybe 2 people that uses cleaning products thoroughly), and the proper sanitary supplies are not readily available. Not even gloves. I've been cut working a handful of times, and not even washing/sanitizing has prevented the infection. People clean the dishes they need and sometimes more before the regular dish shift (6 pm to close), and the only sanitary option in the area is hand sanitizer. I'm not sure how effective this is honestly, but I personally spray my hands off, dry them with a paper towel, apply a generous amount of hand sanitizer and rub it in, then wipe off the excess before handling clean dishes. Other people typically use the sprayer and handle dishes doing little more than using paper towels after, and then proceed to wash their hands and continue food prep. This is alarming, because I can only imagine how much bacteria and fungus have spread throughout the restaurant due to the manager's utter disregard for any proper procedures. I will either be going to the clinic today or tomorrow for a check-up for the infection, but I'm wondering who I should contact to fix this. It's gotten to the point that I almost want a doctor's note to limit me from any food or dish contact and stick to driving, but that wouldn't be fair to others. They're unaware of the issue due to inexperience or ignorance. I've had issues with fungus from unsanitary working conditions in a ""high class"" popular Italian chain restaurant before. Any information is greatly appreciated, if you need any other info, let me know.",0
"[NM, USA] HR Department happily leads a stranger, who has been harassing him in unorthodox ways, to my coworkers office.. Context:

  My coworker (we'll call him Steve) has a 17 year old son. Steve's neighbor is a pretty old crotchety guy (We'll call him OCG) and likes to make noise complaints. OCG even said so to Steve when Steve first moved in. OCG complained to Steve once in person and Steve says to let him know any time he has any problems with noise so he may deal with his son (who may be loud at times because he is 17 years old). He also happens to mention he works at a medium sized company in town (We'll call it McCompany). OCG rents from the property management department in McCompany. Steve does not work in this department, however. 

  The next time OCG decides to complain he goes to the property management department of McCompany and asks the manager to mention this to Steve through his employer connections. Steve tells this to me because he found it weird. Steve also finds out that OCG had tried to file a complaint with the police.


What Happened Today:

OCG decided to visit McCompany's HR department, introduced himself as Steve's neighbor and asked where Steve works because ""He just wants to say 'Hi'"". The HR girl happily leads him into our office, then HR girl pops in and asks where Steve is and I casually mention he was out for some personal stuff and will be back shortly. That's when she mentions to me ""His neighbor is here to say 'Hi'.""

What I'd like to know:

Is what HR girl did illegal? If so, would this law be publicly available for me to read or show to them? (Hopefully with more laws they probably do not abide.) What could my coworker or myself do about this? I really don't feel like my information is safe within the hands on our HR department.

Any help or even a point in the right direction would help and I would be greatly appreciative.",0
"I may lose my job because of a corrupt town in Alabama. As a preface to this story I drive a truck for the nation's largest retailer and they pay me very good (six figures good). 

I was on my off day and took an out of town trip with my wife and kids in the family minivan. We started to approach the small town of Uniontown AL and I was immediately pulled over by a police officer (he passed me going the opposite direction then proceeded to do a unturn to get behind me). I'm puzzled because I always drive safe and legal, my wife always gripes at me for this habit. Before the officer approached my window I had done decided that I must have hit a 45 mph zone without realizing it and I never slowed down from 55 mph. When he approached my window the first thing the officer told me is I was doing 70 in a 55. My jaw dropped because I know I was going 55. I didn't argue with the officer and I didn't confirm or deny doing 70. I pretty much remained silent. He gave me my citation and I carried on. My wife did research on this town's police force and found a message board with so many other horror stories just like mine with people getting pulled over for doing 70 in a 55. So I think it's obvious that this town is running a scam. 

I know the obvious answer is to ""lawyer up"" and I'm planning on doing that this Monday. But my most concerning question is, will that even do any good in a corrupt jurisdiction? I mean if the cops are going to flat out lie and say motorists were speeding then does that mean the staff of the municipal court could be in on it as well? 

And to revisit my beginning statement where I drive truck for the nation's largest retailer... They will not tolerate a serious violation on my mvr. So I'm possibly facing a $100,000/yr job loss. Who knows, they might be understanding and give me a slap on the wrist but either way I'm scared!

"Do I have a case? I am attempting to sue my previous podiatrist. Hi all,

so rewind to about a year ago when I began taking some medicine to remove a foot fungus in the. During one of my last treatment visits in January 2017, I saw a different podiatrist for the first time due to my other podiatrist being out of the office. This new podiatrist may have had an issue with my appearance or something because he did not really address me at all and seemed annoyed by my presence. He did not talk much even though I had asked him a lot of questions about my progress. He takes a quick look at my nails and then proceeded to cut my nails very low, despite my painful cries, without warning me or asking me to do so in the first place. After which he writes me a script for some bogus prescription that didn't help and left without saying anything. Fast forward to May 2017, and I start to develop very uncomfortable pain in one of the toes trimmed down low. Apparently, the low cutting of the toenail resulted in an ingrown toe nail in eventually both toes. A preventative measure to this is to soak your foot in salt water to help the nail grow, but my previous podiatrist did not mention anything about that. 

The ingrown toenail proceeded to get infected, and resulted in the last couple of months of alot of pain, discomfort, expenses on medical supplies, and many trips to the doctor. I really find this podiatrist culpable of all of these issues, especially since the other podiatrist I saw before him did not think it was necessary to cut the nail so low, and has been coaching me through the entire process.

Can I sue that podiatrist I saw in Jan for cutting my nail too low and not giving me any advice after to prevent ingrown toenails?  Are their lawyers out there willing to see this case considering there won't be a lot of money involved? 

Thanks for any legal advice you can provide!",0
"TN/GA - I am 29 years old, but I just realized that my father should have been paying child support from the time I was born until I was 18 and my mother was too poor/prideful to go to court over it. Is there any way I can sue him for back child support?. Long story short, when I was born, my father left my mother (both early 20s) because he didn't want me and wasn't ready to be a Dad. He wanted to keep partying, going to bars and living that lifestyle.

They were married when I was born, but shortly after, got a divorce.

My father was ordered to pay child support until I was 18, but he never did. My Mom was so busy working 2-3 shitty jobs to keep us stable and so upset with my Dad that she never had the time, willpower or resources to do anything about it. She just gave me the whole, ""He'll get his in the end."" speech about karma.

I haven't spoken to my father in over 15 years. Since my early teens.

Well, I'm older now and my adult mind can process what actually happened and I'm not okay with it. I'm 29 now and I was wondering if there is any way I can sue him and collect the money he never paid so I can try to force my Mom to take it. I know she's prideful, but I want to make things right because she still works those same shitty jobs as she did when I was younger and she deserves better than that.

Is there anything I can do legally about the back child support he never paid? I know he has it, because he **still** lives with his mother  (my grandmother), doesn't pay any bills, and my uncle (his brother) tells me that my Dad is into bad drugs and constantly bets thousands of dollars on stupid football games.

It's infuriating what he put my Mom through and I want justice. I'm just hoping that legal action doesn't have to come from my Mom, because I know she will just tell me to let it go like she did.

"[US] Florida company making a ""Trademark Violation"" claim against a username registered by one of my users. I run a small social network that lets users register usernames as their handle. A company which I'll call ""Illusionalsunrise Media"" (not its real name but similar) sent me an email accusing one of my users of committing a trademark violation because she registered the name ""illusionalsunrise"" on my site. But when I search for ""illusionalsunrise"" (again, not the real name) on http://tmsearch.uspto.gov, I see that the word mark is for ""Illusionalsunrise Media"" and not ""Illusionalsunrise"" by itself.

""From the information that we have received regarding your use, our use of this Trademark has priority over yours based upon earlier and continuous use, as well as the above federal registration. Therefore, your use is a violation of our company’s rights.

We are requesting that you remove the use of our trademark described in the provided link or any other name or mark confusingly similar.""

Their actual trademark filing states: FIRST USE: 20160401. FIRST USE IN COMMERCE: 20160401 with a filing date of July 21, 2016 whereas my user registered her account on Oct 14, 2011. My user also doesn't sell anything and is not a business entity so they shouldn't even be in the same industry (it's just a username).

"(WI) Apartment lease ended June 30th, I moved out June 30th, landlord wants me to pay rent for July or will file suit. Hello and thank you for reading. I live in Wisconsin. Sorry if the formatting is odd, this is my first time posting.

In June 2016 I signed a lease that commenced on July 1st, 2016 and ended on June 30th, 2017. This was my first time renting an apartment and I was unaware that it is common etiquette to provide 30 days notice before moving out. I did not provide 30 days notice, instead I messaged my landlord a few days before moving. Today (7/11/17) I just received a text message from my landlord stating that they will be sending me a written notice to pay the rent for July or they will take me to court, and that I should have given 30 days notice prior to moving out. 

Here's the details: 

* The term of my lease commenced on July 1st, 2016 and ended on June 30th, 2017 

* There was no automatic renewal clause 

* I did not receive written notice 15-30 days prior to the ending of the lease that there was an automatic renewal clause 

* Nothing was written in the lease stating I had to give 30 days (or any number of days) notice before leaving

The only relevant wording I can find in the lease are these two statements:

* ""Upon giving written notice no later than 60 days before the expiration of the term of this Lease, the Tenant may renew this Lease for an additional term"" 

* ""During the last 30 days of this Lease, the Landlord or the Landlord's agents will have the privilege of displaying the usual 'For Sale' or 'For Rent' or 'Vacancy' signs on the Premises""

I feel bad for breaking common etiquette and not letting my landlord know prior to 30 days, but I'm not reading anything from Wisconsin that states I have to legally give 30 days notice prior to moving. So, legally, does my landlord have a case against me?

I really appreciate your advice and time.",1
"College charging me for nothing, and also sent my private information through gmail without my permission.. So, I graduated from a community college in California and moved, I wanted to continue my education and get some more technical certifications to improve my skill set. I moved a bit of a drive away but still in California. 

Basically, I arrived to late to register for classes in my new city so I figured I would wait. I get busy with work, don't check my college account for quite a few months. Despite not having attended a class, used any campus services, or even actually set foot on the campus I had a very small bill. Which I had been getting an automated email for every few days.

I send an email asking for information about the charge, saying that I didn't know the source of the charge. I get a reply a bit later saying that it was a system glitch and I was charged in May for fees, that I owed from a year ago. As in before I even applied to enter the new college. 

And the automated bill emails extended back way further than the May date the person gave me. 

Made little sense until I scrolled down, and a screen cap with the account information from my previous school and my previous accounts were presented. That had nothing to do with my accounts for the new school.

But, not only did I not give permission for that information to be sent, the screen cap also included a large amount of personal information, from my previous school.  All of it given, because they confused a charge on my previous schools account, of the same amount that I was concerned about. Which I am not sure how that information was accessed, and which was already paid at the old school. 

I don't know if I am over reacting but, this seems like a massive breach in the protection of my personal information. And, I don't know if I should email them and inquire further, or if I should contact a lawyer.",0
"TX traffic stop for driving in the left lane. [TX] I was driving in the left lane of traffic on highway 361 preparing to pass another car that was 1000 feet in front of me, I realize that I might have gotten into the left lane a little early but they were going slow and we were the only people on the road. As I'm coming up on the car I see a black SUV sitting in the median facing the wrong way and I slow down kind of panicking that they're going to pull out in front of me. I do not change lanes because I'm watching the SUV to see if they pull out in front of me. As I pass the SUV they turn their lights on and I realize it was a cop, I was not speeding at any point. I get pulled over and issued a ticket for driving in the left lane, the cop will not listen to the fact that I was preparing to pass a car until I saw him facing the wrong way in traffic and slowed down. What are my chances of fighting this? It's a $500 ticket and as I wasn't impeding the flow of traffic I don't really see what I did to warrant a ticket. The law is so ambiguous, and there is not place (that I can tell) that tells you when you can officially get into the left lane to pass. 


Also worth noting, I have a Conceal Carry License but I've never owned a gun or really had anything to do with guns. Got it because my boyfriend is in the military and wanted me to get a gun and I kinda forgot I had it. The cop ran my DL and saw that I have a CCL and came back screaming that he could arrest me for not giving him my CCL with my DL but when I took the class they told is that we're under no obligation to give the officer our CLL granted we do not have a gun on our person, which I most definitely did not. I would really like to file an official complaint for this because as far as I can tell, he's just making up law to suit himself but I want to be sure that this is correct before I raise hell at the police station.",0
"Can I (or should I) change the asset allocation of funds under dispute in a property division?. Hello,

Exwife and I have been caught in a contentious, nasty divorce for nearly two years now.  Since 2014 I haven't changed the asset allocation of my investments.  She has claimed a much larger share of these as common property.  Her attorney has claimed my separate property became commingled.  I have so far made a partial tracing, which I believe is accurate (because opposing counsel has so far avoided mentioning it).

I first communicated to my exwife my concern of overexposition to the stock market two years ago.  She ignored it.  I made a new declaration of disclosure last february.  I'm becoming increasingly nervous because opposing side is asking for specific quantities, instead of a reasoned request for a specific number of shares or a percentage, as I've asked them.  I would like to convert some of the investments under dispute into cash or at least move them into less risky investments.  My attorney insists I should not do that, as it might look bad before the judge and I'll become liable for any cap gains tax. 

I feel overburdened because the stewardship over these funds fall on me.  If the stock market makes a downturn, the other side might as well make me responsible for mismanagement and make their demands based on last February's valuation.

Exwife and attorney have successfully delayed the case, asking for more paperwork every time, pretending they didn't receive anything, and so on.  Judge so far has done nothing for me other than set up a mandatory conference..., in two months, just to hear what paperwork the new judge wants to see.  Legal costs just keep mounting and I'm already forced to convert investments into cash to pay for my attorney.  My own expenses, alimony, and attorney fees exceed well over 50% my net pay on a monthly basis.

"[Canada] [Ontario] [Criminal] Age of consent law changed after sexual contact with much older male over long time.. Hey,

When I was 14 in 2003 I met a 24 year old man online whom I later found out I had a girlfriend. We started a sexual relationship in 2003 after I had turned 15, this happened a dozen times or more, and included everything barring penetrative sex, ending November 2004.

He told me he loved me, that he'd leave his partner for me, was my source of counsel and support while I was going through problems at home including going to live in foster care.

I know that at this time, the legal age of consent was 14 in Canada, and that this was ""upgraded"" to 16 in 2008 when I was 19, 4 years after the contact ended.

Are there any exceptions to this rule? I know there is a law that nullifies the age of consent law if he was in a position of authority, but he wasn't my baseball coach, nor was he a teacher. I have pretty in depth diary entries from that time to provide proof of my emotional state, and some verbatim copy and paste AIM messages between him and I. 

Are you aware of any cases in Canadian criminal court where something like this was allowed to go ahead?

I would just take a walk down to my local police station and speak to a detective, but I live aboard now and am back in the city where this happened for 2 weeks in a few months, so any conversations I've had with detectives over the phone have been very hypothetical, but they've encouraged me to come down.

I appreciate all you can offer me in way of legal advice is a guide, as well as hypothetical. Regardless of what happens, I will of course still go to the station to give a statement and submit my evidence so that the detectives and attorneys can make a decision, but I'm sure you can imagine that being thousands of miles away, unable to speak to someone now, I am quite anxious.

"Foriegn person problems with home depot gardening refund and potential sting (CA, USA). I have had many interactions with Home Depot's customer service over the 4th of July weekend. They tried to overcharge me two a half times over a $500 order. In the end I had to beg a friend's family member to make 6+ trips to the store that is serveral miles  away using  a 4 seater car, instead of the company's delivery truck that should have arrived 48 after the order was placed. 

I contacted the home depot's customer  support after 96 hours of not hearing from them and I was told by them I had to come into the store, which was the only way for me to pick up even just half of the merchandise that I was overcharged for because they did not have enough in stock. They gave me a small discount in the store and I returned home less then 1/3 of my total order due to my noticing of  a large discrepancy on the pricing of the item in question when I was checking on it on my tablet on the website whilst in store.

The next morning I  re opened neutral negotiations with my growing antagonist and calmly asked for why there was such a discrepancy and why I was overcharged, not informed of a delay in shipping or even contacted at all. After 3 hours of contacting their support rep and getting nowhere I ended up ordering the same exact gardening supplies on my friends Amazon prime and informed Home Depot that I wanted a full refund on all the merchandise that I had not received. Although my original payment method at home depot's website was a credit card instead of refunding the money to my card, I just received a call this morning asking me to come into the store in person to receive the refund. Why would they do this rather then just refund my card?

All I am doing is a little legal (as of this year) gardening and I am not white and they were all Caucasian, so to me it seems a little bit sketchy. Any opinions ?",0
"Employment Law: Lost Wages.. TLDR 

I'm worried my boss won't pay me for work that I've already done.  What are my options if that happens?  I am depending on the money.

I work a crappy minimum wage night shift job and handed in my notice last night.

I also slept through the first hour of my shift and made the decision to quit as I was getting ready to leave for work.  I told my boss over text. 

My boss then tried to guilt - trip me into coming in anyways.  When I said no she said fine at least do the rest of your scheduled shifts and I said yes.. but only because I wanted to end the conversation. 

I don't want to go back.  I don't need the four days of pay and I have had two mental breakdowns in less then a month because of this job.  I really don't want go back.  

This morning, going through my records, I noticed that I didn't get the proper raise for my overtime hours.  Judging from talks with another employee (only one) this was intentional.  I am also missing a few hours of pay.  Honestly this stuff isn't a big deal to me but it happened if it helps.  

However, there is still one week of work.. Another 48 hours, 4 of which should be overtime.  I'm worried that if I don't show up for my next set of shifts that my boss won't pay me for the work I've done.  I need that money.  If she does this.. what are my options?

"[USA: FL, WI, NJ] Movers violated contract, BOA closed the dispute claim without returning my money. In May, I hired a moving company (Company A, located in FL) to move me from WI to NJ. Our contract stated that they would move me on the 19th or the 20th of May. I (stupidly) paid $520.00 as a partial payment.


On May 19th, I get a call from someone identifying himself as a dispatcher, saying they will be picking up my stuff on the 20th in the afternoon and will call me before they come. The 20th comes and goes with no call until 10:30pm at night saying they will be there in the morning of the 21st. At that point, I had already scrambled and hired other movers because 1) they never showed up and 2) I could only pay by cash or money order which was super sketchy to me.


I called Company A and told them what happened and that I wanted my $520 back. They told me they would call me back. Unsurprisingly, they never returned by call, my multiple messages, or my emails and even stoped answering my calls. 


I disputed the charge with BOA a few days after the 20th of May. I was notified today that they are closing the claim and not returning my money. They said that Company A did not break our contract because they subcontracted the move to Company B, and it is Company B that did not pick up my stuff at the date range specified in the contract. 


I feel like it's not a large enough amount of money to hire a lawyer, but it's not an insignificant amount and I'd like to get my money back from this shady moving company. I'm angry that Company A did not tell me they were subcontracting and that they refused to return any of my multiple communications. They've also never provided any contact information or even a name for Company B. 


In terms of next steps, I'm planning on writing a letter to the claims department to get them to return the $520. Is there anything else I should do to get my money returned?",0

* Has spread multiple lies about me, which I can prove are false.
* Has accused me of slander and defamation despite only writing true, varifiable things in my review (such as suggesting potential clients refer to the bar associations website where they can view public records of their censures against this lawyer)
* Is threatening to sue me for legal fees from when his firm was attempting to assist me for my accident
* Is threatening me with lawsuits, again

I am feeling harassed and bullied.  I plan to speak with my attorney, as well as getting a second opinion from other local attorneys about the matter.

what do you think?

1.  Do you think I can take him to court for harassment?
2.  Do you think the bar association would get involved on my behalf?  I actually contacted them a few months ago and they seemed interested, h has further harassed me since.
3.  do you think I have anything to worry about when it comes to his (IMO false) claims of slander and defamation?",0
"WI. Does my landlord have a case against me?. Hey everyone,

So I am not really sure what to do. Back in January, I moved out of my apartment because of a roommate that broke my door down, threw items at me, and threatened to kill me in the middle of the night. He proceeded to text threats for the next few days until I blocked his number. I immediately filed the police report and had my landlord there while the police were the following day. The roommate who threatened me continued to live there so i moved out within a week. I sent a letter to my landlord describing the situation and how there is a legitimate fear of my life because this roommate has a past history of violence.

I then did what this paragraph said and sent a letter with the police report via certified mail.

The Safe Housing Act allows victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and child abuse to terminate a lease if they feel they are in imminent threat of physical harm by remaining on the premises, and have an accepted form of documentation (a restraining order, condition of release, or a criminal complaint). Very specific rules apply. To end a lease under these laws, tenants with a term lease must write a letter to the landlord saying that they wish to end their lease under Wis. Stat. 704.16 because they and/or their child(ren) face an imminent threat of physical harm, and provide a certified copy of the accepted documentation (example: a court order) to the landlord. Under these limited circumstances, the lease would end as if giving a termination notice for a month-to-month tenancy. Wis. Stat. 704.16, Wis. Stat. 704.16(1)(b)

My roommates said they had found someone to take my place, but that must have fallen through. Now it is July. I am now hearing that my landlord is pursuing legal action against me, but I have only heard about this just recently and have not been served.

"Dealership trying to take back new car after 10 day period expired. [CA]. I need some help here.
(All events/transactions occurred in CA where I am also living with a valid CA address.)

I purchased a new car on 5/27/17. My credit is poor but my income is high so I qualified for a loan with a high down payment and a trade in. After being approved, I worked a better deal with the dealership to simply put more money down and not use the trade in. We agreed, signed all the paperwork, I drove off the lot with a brand new car.

My first payment is due 7/11/17. I've been trying for the last few days to enroll online and pay my loan but had no luck. Kind of panicked, I emailed my dealership for some help and then called the financeer who tells me that I have two loan open - one that's expired and one that's declined.

I called the dealership immediately who tell me, 'We've been trying to get a hold of you, we need the car back immediately. The financeer sent back the contract when the trade-in was pulled from the table. Bring the car back today or tomorrow. By boss just told me about this this weekend and said we need to get the car back from you.'

I responded with, 'No one has attempted to contact me about this. I have emails from my salesperson asking me how my car is over the last few weeks but no emails, calls, texts, or postal mail regarding the contract or financing. I will not turn in the car until I speak with the Director of Finance.'

They told me the Director will be in in the morning and will call me first thing.

I'm not really sure what to do here. This happened to me last year when trying to purchase a new Mazda and that dealership had mailed certified letter rescinding the contract on the 10th day so I was obligated to return the car. Need some help.

tl;dr - Dealership could not find financing 30 days after signing the contract and is asking for the car to be returned. Do I have any rights?",0
"We got stranded in China due to ticket confirmation issues. Tickets bought from JustFly.com We had to spend over $3000 USD out of pocket to get back to USA. Any possible recourse?. So mom and I bought roundtrip tickets from Kansas City to Fuzhou, China on JustFly.com. Outgoing flights were KC to Seattle to Shanghai to Fuzhou. Return flights were Fuzhou to Beijing to Seattle to KC.  

When we arrived in Shanghai, we had to hop on a different, domestic Chinese airline (Juneyao Air) to go to Fuzhou and get another boarding pass. The agent there did not give us any boarding pass since they said that whomever purchased the ticket (JustFly.com) had sent some kind of incorrect ticket/reservation confirmation number and it didn't match any of our passport or visa numbers. We were stuck in Shanghai and were told that the only way to get to Fuzhou was to buy our own separate ticket in China to go to Fuzhou. Which is what we did. 

When we were coming back to the US, at the airport in Fuzhou they said that the rest of our reservation was cancelled since we did not take the last leg from Shanghai to Fuzhou. We had to then buy tickets that day to come back to the US...which cost us double what we paid for the entire roundtrip ticket. 

Just called JustFly.com now to discuss any possibility of refund (we have receipts in China of flights we bought) and they flat out refused. They said that 1) any missed leg causes rest of the roundtrip to be cancelled....and 2) that if the confirmation # was wrong then we wouldn't have been able to even start our journey.  

Any potential recourse? Dispute this with my CC company(Chase?) The roundtrip ticket itself was about $2600 and the way back out of China was over $3000 (about 20,000 Chinese RMB converting to USD currency). So total out 5-6k.  Not sure if it's even worthwhile to see if we can retain legal counsel to sort this out? 

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!",0
"I have a feeling that I may soon be fired/let go from my office job for my internet usage (reddit, sports only, no adult sites). What will happen if I lie and deny the history?. I'm an idiot. I've been spending, on average, 3-4 hours a day out of my 7.5 hour work-day (Monday - Friday, 9 - 5) for the past... 2 years on this website, both general surfing and posting (probably 2000 posts? no idea, at least that). I'm the only person in the company who does what I do, I took over for a retiree and there was no manual/documentation of anything, I just trained with her for a month and then learned the rest on my own and I'm integral to the department (primarily finance/secondarily admin role, don't want to get more detailed).  

My boss isn't a very good actor and he's been saying/doing a lot of things over the past few weeks that make me think they're trying to get me to tell them everything about how I do my job, before they fire me. I've never had a warning for the amount of internet usage or anything but there's no reason otherwise they'd consider firing me, and like I said, I can read my boss pretty well and he's not a good actor.  

If they do tell me that they're firing me and it's due to the high usage, can I say ""No, that wasn't me""? Like, can I demand proof? I'm not part of a union and I'm *pretty sure* they can fire me for any reason, but would making a demand like that do anything? Is there any possibility of legal repercussions if I argue it and make them prove it? The company is undergoing very public downsizing, so if I say I got laid off I can go on unemployment benefits, but if I got fired then I wouldn't be eligible. **Side question** If I file for unemployment, would the company tell the unemployment office that I was fired as opposed to let go? I assume yes, but would like to know. I realize I'm a piece of shit, I'm looking for a new job either way so all of this is just temporary anyways.",0
"(MI) My roommates and I are being sued, seeking guidance about a couple key points of the case.. As the title says, my roommates and I are being sued by a former landlord to the tune of roughly $7500 after a tenancy that stretched from 2014 until April of 2017. The bulk of the charges come from painting ($3000) and carpeting ($3200). In addition to these charges there are $600 in damages that they are attempting to charge us for that appear on the initial commencement checklist as being previously damaged, signed in 2014 at the outset of the lease. They are also suing us for their attorney's fees; one of my biggest questions regarding the issue is if they are allowed to do this and if so is there a limit to the amount we can be held liable for?

There are some damages we do not contest, such as wall dings, scratches, and a broken kitchen drawer, however, we assert that the ""damage"" to the paint and carpet was normal wear and tear over the course of a 3 year lease. Some of the paint in the home at lease origination was noted as ""freshly painted"", while other rooms were not. The carpets were dirty at the time of lease inception and one of the tenant's parents rented a carpet cleaner and cleaned them before they moved in, it is our belief that the carpets in the home may be original to the home (built 1997), but we do not know for sure.

After we moved out of the home the landlords fully re-painted and re-carpeted the entire house and have since sold it. It is our belief that they are attempting to leverage our security deposit and other alleged damages to offset the costs of their renovation of the property. 

Ultimately, the main questions I have regarding our case are whether or not the life expectancy of the paint and carpeting was exceeded by the term of the lease and whether or not we are liable for their attorney fees should we choose to go to court. Any help or suggestion would be greatly appreciated!",1
"[Texas] Can a property owner file tresspassing charges with only a license plate? What about if they have a name as well?. TL;DR: Drove onto private property, got stuck. Property owner found me and said he was going to file trespassing charges, but he (likely) doesn't have any info besides my license plate. Drove away without any further interaction.

Full version: I was driving late at night following my GPS, and went down a dirt road. I was eventually lead to a point where the county road turned into a private road on a large ranch. It was pretty clearly marked no tresspassing, but it was ungated and looked like the shortest route to the highway I needed to get to (yes, I know I'm a dumbass for not turning around.) I drove down the road, but eventually came to a point where my puny sedan got stuck on the rocky dirt road. With no way out, I called roadside assistance. They had a lot of trouble finding me, owing to the fact that I was not on a publicly marked road. The driver that was coming to winch me out eventually found the property entrance, and apparently encountered the property owner. I don't know exactly what was said between them, but eventually the property owner drove the RA driver to me in his truck. The property owner gets out and informs me that he's going to file tresspassing charges while the RA looks at my car. Property owner then takes the RA back without saying anything else, or asking me anything. RA comes back with his truck, winches my car out, and I drive off the property without ever seeing the property owner again. I'm pretty sure the only info the property owner could have about me is my license plate. It's *possible* the RA gave him my name. I doubt it, but I didn't think to ask to be sure.

So my question is: Could the property owner file charges with the info they have? If they do, how will I know? I live in the same state, but several hundred miles away from where this happened.",0
"[FL] Fiance's is not able to see his daughter. Obligatory this post is not about me but about my fiance (22 M). It is also necessary for me to say that him and I live in WA but his daughter lives in FL so this is a Florida state matter.

So my fiance got a girl pregnant when he was living in Florida. The child is now three years old (possibly 4 but I am pretty sure she's only 3). Anyway, his daughter was born while he was in basic training and he is now active duty military stationed here in WA which is where I met him and it is where he has been since. The mother of his child requested that he have a paternity test and he agreed. This was a little over a year ago.
Since he has taken the test (it was positive), he has had to pay an ordered amount in child support since then which is automatically deducted from his pay and was slammed with owing around $12,000 in back child support which he now makes extra payments every month on that as well to keep him from going to jail.
Additionally, the mother of his daughter refuses to let him see her or even have any contact with her. He always pays his support since he has had to and has no criminal history of any kind or any reason for him not to see her. I assume since he is required to pay child support, he has joint custody of the child even though he does not live there. He is also not named on her birth certificate.

So my question for anyone who has been in this situation before or anyone who has knowledge of FL laws regarding this, what rights does my fiance have to see his daughter and additionally, is it right that he now owes so much money in back child support from before he took the paternity test and how can we resolve this situation for him?

Also, there is talk from him about wanting to surrender his rights over. His logic is that if he isn't allowed to see her, why bother paying child support for her. So fine people of Reddit, can you give me any advice?",0
"[CA] Becoming responsible for previous tenants overdue rent after taking over lease under the table.. My friend (friend A) lived in a 3 bedroom house with 2 other roommates. Me and friend B were offered the opportunity to move in once the school year ended and take over the lease for friend A's roommates (Lease ends in July but we planned on renewing and the landlord gave us the OK). Great location near our college we both agreed and in June once the other two roommates moved out, we moved in. However upon signing up on the online website to pay rent we found out that the 2 previous roommates didn't pay rent for the previous month (May) which ended up totaling at $800. We contacted our property management to try and solve the issue with zero response. This week we received a 3 day notice to ""Pay rent or quit""  to which we immediately called the property management company in which the only response they would really give us was ""We don't care who pays it, it just needs to be paid or else there is zero chance you can renew your lease"" Today me and friend A went into the property management company to discuss this situation to which they told us the same thing but also said we should email the head of the property management company because he may possibly find us a way to fix this. Before I email him I wanted to get some advice moving forward because a mistake in these moments I know could be very crucial. 
I know the obvious situation would be to just GTFO but after only two months we just got settled into this place and have been great tenants since we came here and I would hate to be forced out of here.  We have been responsible tenants since June 1st and have been trying to work through this situation with them. Any advice/questions or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!

"Served Peanuts in Las Vegas. On mobile, throwaway, first time posting, etc etc. 

So I'm currently in Las Vegas, Nevada on vacation. I'm originally from Alberta Canada. Tonight me and a group of girls went out for some Asian fusion. Unfortunately I am anaphylactic to peanuts. I carry meds in case of a reaction and always tell the waitress of my allergy. 

So at dinner we decided to let the server just bring us food that would end up totalling $40-50 each and sharing instead of each ordering something individually. I told her at the beginning that I am severely allergic to peanuts. This allergy includes peanut oil. Server says great she understands. Awesome. 

So our food comes out, one dish being chicken satay. I double check with the server that dropped it off (not our waitress) that the satay does not have peanuts. He says nope, it does not. Great! He said the dressing in the salad (which wasn't on our table yet) might have peanuts and he'll go check. So I start dishing up. I use chopsticks to put some veggie dumplings on my plate. I then grab some other food and eat it. Notice an immediate allergic reaction. Not awesome. 

The waitress then hurries over and says don't eat the dumplings as they are cooked in peanut oil. Unfortunately I used the same chopsticks to pick up the dumpling as I did to eat something else. So serious cross contamination. We call the hotel paramedic and an ambulance. I spend about three hours in the hospital for observation. I gave myself my epipen and Benadryl at the restaurant. They gave me prednisone at the hospital. Had an IV and fluids given. 

My question is do I have any grounds to sue? I'm pretty pissed since we're here on vacation and I felt like shit. I do have travellers insurance so the hospital stay will be covered by them. I'm really just curious what my options are. Thanks!

"[CA] Young adult applying for guardianship of mentally ill Mom. Having conflicts with her trustee. Does she have any rights?. My mom has schizophrenia. Her brother is the trustee of a large inheritance given to her by her Dad. This inheritance is her main source of income. He's also the executor of my Dad's estate who just recently passed away. 

My uncle wants to sell her house and put her in a assisted living home. She's only 60. She wants to stay in her home, where we she is currently being taken care of by a caregiver. 

He's not providing her any sort of autonomy or transparency about the decisions he's making. He also refuses to allow me to have any  knowledge of how much she has and how its being invested. I know she has (800k+).

Right now I'm trying to figure out where her rights start and his end. And also if it would be worth applying for guardianship, I'm only 25 and not exactly that established yet. Would applying for her guardianship allow me to hold him accountable for decisions?

I just hate the idea that he's making these life decisions she doesn't agree with. He's doing this under the guise of it being in her best interest, but if that were the case he would allow her to be apart of that decision and would be sensitive to the fact that her husband just died four months ago. He wants the sell the house she's lived in for over 17 years and put her there within the next few months. From my understanding he wants to do this to lessen his responsibilities of taking care of her. 

I'm also concerned about him making decisions about the kind of medical care she receives. She has the mental capacity I believe to make her own medical decisions. With other family members in the past, he has prioritized money over care, and I would hate to see him do the same thing with my Mom. 

Does anyone have any idea about how to approach this? I don't where to start or how I go about any of this. Am I asking the right questions?",0
"[US]Ex-Wife (NYC) threatening to sue me (CA) for half of our wedding?. Hi all, 

This is my throwaway because obviously. This all happened in NYC.

My ex and I had a tumultuous relationship, we separated in May of 2015 after a year of marriage, a full no-contest divorce followed in early 2016. 

We had a huge wedding (100% her choice/decision, I wanted something smaller and much less grand). Neither of us were making much money at the time, and she had received a large inheritance from her grandmother previously which she used to pay for the wedding. 

When we separated and ultimately divorced we stayed friendly-ish, but she always carried a resentment over the money she spent on the wedding. I told her (though never in a documented format) that should I ever be in a very comfortable financial situation I would be happy to repay her a portion of the wedding fund. 

A little current add on, I am technically homeless, make very little money, and although I have prospects on the horizon by no means could you call my situation comfortable, something closer to strained. 

She emailed me recently about a ""financial situation"" she wanted to discuss with me, after some pressing she explained that she was threatening legal action to recoup half of the cost of our wedding as well as interest starting from our separation in 2015. 

I'm sure the main advice would be to get a lawyer, which is rough as I literally have little to no money. My main curiosity is, is it even possible for her to sue me for that, especially since that's something she would have had to have handled during the divorce, and without any documentation of me stating explicitly ""I will pay you such and such"" does this threat have any real validity? My main assumption is that she's hurting for cash and knowing my situation thinks if she threatens legal action she will be able to squeeze a few pennies from my well. 

Thank you all in advance for any advice you can offer.",0
"[CA] Now that wife has green card, I think she will file for divorce - should I be afraid?. Now that we have just applied for my wife’s 10-year green card I suspect she may file for divorce. The ~3 marriage has struggled, due largely to factors stemming from unemployment (at times *both* of us have been unemployed). Finally and thankfully, we both have good jobs now, though they are in different states (I am in CA, where we married, she is in NY) so it’s now a long-distance marriage. I love her but I think she has checked out and I have to agree that with our new jobs if there were ever a time for a ""fresh start,"" now is it. If she files, I anticipate a ""peaceful"" separation. There's no rancor between us and not much to divide up--no kids, few assets, just a few thousand $ in the bank. If she took everything in the bank it would just be an inconvenience, really. 


However, if there is one thing I have learned from this sub it’s that relying on the goodwill of an ex-spouse is asking for a disaster, and I wonder if I should be on-guard for something? For instance, could she somehow come after my future wages? Also, during one particularly difficult stretch, my parents gave us some financial support, can she go after them somehow? I think it impossible she would ever attempt such a thing even if she had recourse, but really sad things are reported on this sub every day. 


One last thing: If I've accepted the inevitability of divorce, why don't I just file for it myself and get it over with? One is that I do hope this marriage might rebound and her family is emphatically behind me. Another is that I want to put all my energy into my new job and don’t anticipate acquiring much in savings or significant assets this year, I personally would prefer to defer the divorce until it has to happen. 


Thanks and blessings. 


TL/DR. I feel divorce is inevitable. Can I just wait for it to happen or is it urgent that I pre-emotively lawyer-up?",0
"Is it legal to charge a missed appointment fee even though I cancelled in advance?. Hi all,

I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this, and also- throwaway because I'm paranoid.

I had an appointment with my regular podiatrist back in June. I've been a patient for years and have never missed an appointment. The doctor is very well-respected in our area and is booked out months in advance. 

On Thursday, June 8th, I got an email at 4:45 PM stating I had an appointment on Monday, June 12th at 1:45 PM. There was not an option to cancel the appointment from the email, so I called the next day, June 9th to cancel my appointment. The time of my call was 1:52 PM. When I spoke with the woman on the phone, I told her I had to cancel my appointment for Monday. She went ahead and cancelled it.

A couple of weeks ago, I received a bill from the doctors office for $35 for a ""missed appointment fee"". I called the office to remind them that I did in fact call, and I would be happy to being in a copy of my phone records to show I spoke with someone. The lady said because I called at 1:52 and not 1:45, I was outside of the 24-hour business day window so I had to be assessed a fee. 

There was absolutely nothing in writing saying that I had to cancel 24 hours in advance, Not only that, but the same woman who I've been speaking with on the phone didn't inform me on Friday (when I called to cancel) that I would have to pay a fee regardless because I was outside of that window. Why would by bill say missed appointment fee instead of late-cancellation fee? The only conclusion I could come up with is that she dropped the ball on her end and now I'm left 

The office wont budge and I fear that this will end up in collections. It's a small amount, but it's twice what my copay would have been and I literally live paycheck to paycheck, on the penny. I don't know what else I can do from here. Is there a way to dispute it without going through the office?",0
"Can I successfully sue my neighbor for this?. Located in North Dakota. 

PICTURES OF DAMAGE ARE LINKED AT BOTTOM OF POST

I posted in this subreddit a few weeks ago. Long story short, I own a twinhome. My neighbors are renters. One of my neighbors moved their sump pump hose right outside my basement window, and it proceeded to come into my basement destroying my carpet and padding. 

It was suggested in here to file an insurance claim, which I did. 

First I filed with my own insurance company, and they said they wouldn't cover it as they would consider it to be ""flood damage"" and I don't have flood coverage. They suggested to file a claim through the other homeowners policy policy, and it may fall under their liability coverage. 

So that's what I did. His insurance company sent out an adjustor, inspected the damage, and did his thing. A week later, I got a call from the insurance company saying they wouldn't cover it, since it wasn't their insured (the actual homeowner) that caused the damage, but rather the person renting the home from him. I asked if the homeowner has any liability for his renters actions, and the insurance company said no, not at all. 

So now I'm in my present situation.  I paid 2300 dollars for carpet and padding, which is going to be installed on Tuesday. Admittedly, this carpet is nicer than the carpet I had to take out (5 dollars a Sq foot as opposed approx 3 dollars a Sq foot for the original). 

I know my neighbor isn't going to want to pay for the damages they caused, as that is the nature of negligent neighbors. So I'm guessing my ultimate course of action will be to take them to small claims court. I'm only really armed with pictures of the damage as well as pictures of where my neighbor left his sump pump hose. Is this enough to get a judgment in my favor? I've never gone to court for anything, so any opinions are appreciated.

"[Pennsylvania] Cited with underage drinking, under 18 years old. Hi all,

I'm a freshman at Penn State, and I was just cited for underage drinking yesterday. I went to a party off campus, and had a bit too much to drink. I got back to my dorm room fine, and I wasn't being disorderly/causing any problems with anyone. I basically just stumbled back to my dorm and was ready to go to sleep.

However, I wasn't handling the alcohol very well and began to puke into my dorm's trash can. My roommate walks in on me puking and is panicking because he has never dealt with an intoxicated person before. He calls the RA because he was concerned for my health, and the RA calls 911.

A cop arrives at my dorm and starts asking me questions. He asks me how much I had to drink, and I told him I had a few beers. He then asks me questions like ""What's the month/date"", ""Who's the President of the United States"", and what state I was in. I answered all of the questions correctly, and I was being pretty compliant the entire time. I tell him my home phone number and he calls my parents.

He tells my parents that I was drinking underage and that he was going to send a citation to their address (not my dorm). He didn't leave me with a citation or any other documents at my dorm. I'm 17, so legally not an adult yet.

The EMS later arrive and take my blood pressure, heart rate, all that stuff. Everything was fine and they left. No one ever breathalyzed me. 

Basically, I'm really worried about what happens next. I have to meet with a university administrator about my underage now and complete an alcohol program run by the university. But I'm more worried about what shows up on my record now. Is there anything I can do to get it off my record? I'm supposed to be starting ROTC in the fall, and something like this on my record can apparently be really bad for that. I've wanted to serve in the military for so long and I don't want to miss out on this opportunity before I even start.",0
"[NJ] Question regarding security deposit. I moved out of a one bedroom apartment and into a two bedroom apartment within the same apartment complex at the end of May.

Waited a few days and still didn't receive anything, called him after the July 4th holiday and he said it should be here Monday or Tuesday (7/10-7/11) Still nothing. Called again and he told me to check the old apartment. I did and there was nothing there, which I told him the next day. Then he said he had to call some woman and ask her about it tomorrow or the next day, whenever she was in the office. Didn't hear from him, sent and email asking about it, no response, called him the next day (late last week) and he said we should receive it today or tomorrow. We got our mail today and have still not received it. Perhaps we will receive it tomorrow.  I have a few questions. If we do not receive it tomorrow, is it required that I send a demand letter requesting the deposit before taking him to court? My second question is, even if we do receive it tomorrow, can I still take him to court for being 2+ weeks late in returning it? And finally, after looking up some reviews I found someone that dealt with this landlord and apartment complex to have the same issue I am having and when they finally got their secuirty deposit back, they only received their secuirty deposit but none of the interest it accumulated so she took him to court and got the interest, plus some additional money for getting the security deposit back late.

"My boss hasn't paid me. Hi all. I work part time at a shitty job that I really don't enjoy. I keep track of my hours and I have gotten paid for all of them except for two.

I worked for four days on the week of June 26th and last Friday on July 7th.

I'm supposed to get paid weekly. So let's say I work the week of June 26th; I get paid for that week the that Friday, June 30th.

So I go in June 30th for my pay for the week of June 26th, and my boss says he is busy and because I did not call to let him know I would be picking up my paycheck, he will pay me next time I come in. Okay, fair.

I come in July 2nd and my boss tells me he may as well consolidate the check for the week of July 26th and my pay for whatever other days I work on the week of July 3rd.

So I come in Friday the 7th of July to work, and while I am working my boss tells me checks didn't come in this week, they should be in by Wednesday, July 12th.

Isn't this in violation of the FLSA? He hasn't paid me for the close of a pay period (Week of June 26th and the Friday of June 7th, which he told me he would consolidate).

What should I do? Can/should I take legal action before tomorrow? If tomorrow rolls around and he doesn't pay me, what do I do?

I do not know any personal information about my boss. No contact info, anything. I know his first and last name. The only way to reach him is at my place of work, if he's there, and if he feels like coming to the phone because 50% of the time he's busy. I also overheard him talking to a coworker where the coworker told him he recalled once when he hadn't paid him for months- because my boss needed his social security. Is what my boss is doing illegal? He's not paying us adequately, and he is hiring people without their social security. He also handles tons of raw food without gloves and forces us to do the same. Asking to use gloves while handling results in a simple answer from him: a firm 'no'. Can someone help? I feel like this place is very shady.",0
"Mom bought a car, owner skipped town without handing over title?. So it's a little more complicated that I felt I could put in the title. I'm posting on behalf of my mom who doesn't use Reddit.
So she (stupidly) bought a used car all cash from a shady internet ad without consulting anyone. She's newly divorced and was very much a kept woman who was ZERO real world experience, so she meets the guys and arranges to buy the car. She pulls out all the cash and hands it over without receiving any paperwork! She drove away happy as a clam with only the key in her hands, and insured it that day no issues. She has some papers about the car ( I will have to ask and see what specifically ) but no title and the bill of sale is not signed properly. To add another headache the car is apparently a salvage.... one of the papers she does have is a receipt (with pictures) from when he bought it at an auction practically totaled, then fixed himself. She hid this from us in shame when she quickly realized she couldn't register it in the state we live (Nevada) and get plates as she bought it in California and it has California plates that are not in the system. I had a police officer run them and he says they do not exist in his system. It's been months and he has ceased contact, his phone is disconnected, and the ""business"" he worked at is the only address we have which returned our letter. So she bought this thing almost a year ago and only told us about it maybe three months ago while stashing it in a storage unit so we wouldn't scold her. We asked her wtf she was thinking and she admitted she didn't know cars had paperwork... What the hell steps do I take here? After trying to sort this out with him over these months the only thing he sent me was an incomplete title request that the dmv marked as invalid and.. duh.. incomplete. Our last phone call he said that was enough paperwork for us to sort it out and after that is radio silence. Is she out all that money? Please help..",0
"Can I take legal action against other Amazon sellers using blatantly fake accounts to generate blatantly fake reviews?. I am an Amazon Seller.  I sell various products, and I work hard to position them as high in the search results as possible.  I've been working on some products for months or years, and they slowly gain position in the search pages leading to more sales - but it takes time.  Lots of time.

Recently a competitor started selling a similar product.  (When I say ""similar"" I really mean ""exactly the same"", but with their label on it.  Which is fine, that happens all the time.)  The problem is that this seller generated dozens of completely fake five star reviews, getting his product in the top 10 search results within a week. That's right.  On exceptionally high-volume search results, he got to the top 10 in a week. 

The reviews are obviously fake.  The people leaving the reviews have never reviewed any other product except for this guys.  They all left over-the-top, gushing reviews about how the freaking product ""changed their life.""  Each left pictures and videos.  Me and a friend traced back all of the accounts, and believe we mapped out a pretty decent network of sellers that work together creating fake accounts and leaving fake reviews.  The evidence is strong.

So we reported them to Amazon.  Two months ago.  Nothing has happened. Our sales have suffered.  This practice is in direct violation of Amazons terms, but they don't seem to have any interest in enforcing their own rules.  I've read that Amazon is going to bring a lawsuit against these types of buyers/sellers, but I'll believe it when I see it.

Is there any sort of legal action we legal sellers can take against the illegal sellers?  I believe that leaving fake reviews is in violation of some federal laws, is that correct?  Can we report them to a federal agency?  Can I have a lawyer write up some scary-sounding/threatening letter?  What are my options?

I am in the US.  Thanks you.",0
"[California] Does the removal of this phrase make a huge difference in the contract?. I'm not sure if this question is acceptable in this subreddit. So I will ask my question, and if people suggest hiring a lawyer, then I request advice on how to find the right type of lawyer for my situation. 

After graduating from college, I spent six months working on a startup which was unsuccessful. Then I began searching for a job, and I put my accomplishments during my startup on my resume. After six months of job searching, I received my first job offer with a company in the same field as my startup, but it's a 3-month consulting agreement. The CTO of the company said if it's a good fit I will be offered a full-time position afterward. I read the consulting agreement and analyzed it with a plagiarism checker. I discovered over 90% of the contract came from two online contracts, and one major difference I found was the removal of a phrase in a statement. To summarize the statement, the online contract says: ""the company has rights to all my ideas, designs, etc, that I develop while performing my services under this agreement"". The contract I received does not have the last phrase so the statement says: ""the company has rights to all my ideas, designs, etc."".  I spoke with the CTO about this, and he said I could make changes to the contract, and they would consider it. At the moment, I had doubt in negotiating and told him I sought a permanent position. So I declined the offer. A week later I regretted not negotiating and asked for another opportunity. He said they might give me another opportunity, but they will be unable to change the wording of the contract. If I sign the contract, is it possible that I will give them rights to all my accomplishments I achieved during my startup?

Let me know if you need additional information. I am on the fence about hiring an attorney/lawyer to help me with my situation, but I would like to get advice from this subreddit first. Thanks.",0
"[NY/PA] Mental mother trying to stir up legal trouble again. Long story short when I was younger my mother cheated on my father with a new man who would do drugs together with my mom and abuse her right infront of me. My mother would never press charges and always go to court to get custody to see me, this happened around when I was 10 or so and when I lived in PA. I am 18 now and live in NY. I have not contacted her in a long time, she has always mailed letters but I never respond neither do my 11 or 16 year old siblings. Recently in the mail we got a summons saying we must speak to her at certain times during certain days with a video call. I know she has tried to do this in the past and she would lie and say that my biological father (the one my siblings and I live with in NY) would either not give us the letters as he is required to do, or say he is saying bad things about her ( he never talks about her) I feel like she is going to do that again, but I know I am 18 and legally dont have to talk to her, I feel she will pin some junk on me anyway. 

What I am asking is, is there anyway for me to I dont know the term really, sue? counter suit? anyway is there anyway for me to get financial compensation for the mental abuse she has caused me and the damages it has done to my life. I am 18, and I recently started therapy again ( I have always been scared to do therapy ) and so far it is great, unfortunately I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression from the trauma she has put me though. One year ago I tried to work a full time job and I could not mentally handle it and had to leave, the following fall into winter I was accepted into a 4 year Civil Engineering study at college but same story, my PTSD got the best of me and I had to leave. These are just 2 of the many many many marks she has left one me . She has destroyed my life. Is there anything I can do to get her off my back and end this once and for all.

"I [21F] am working at a pizza place in California and my boss is acting suspiciously. I have been working at this pizza place for 8 months, and recently a shift manager at another location was fired. My boss started training me as shift manager at our location so I could replace the fired shift manager. I had to request 9 days off to go see my doctor in Arizona, and I was supposed to start at the new location when I came back. Coming back from Arizona I was nervous, because I think I did not receive sufficient training for my new position (I was never shown how to open, when that is part of the responsibilities of the shift manager). My boss messaged me this morning telling me to talk to the guy who runs the other location. Here starts my concern. When I showed up at the new location today my boss' boss did not know I was going to start as shift manager at all, and had already started training someone else for the position. He did not know I was coming over to talk either, even though my boss had supposedly set up our meeting. He said he was not sure when he would be able to put me on the schedule at his location, and it would not be as shift manager. I messaged my boss and told him how embarrassed I had been for showing up at the new location with the intent to start as shift manager and getting to know no such arrangements had been made. My boss told me he had forgot to tell the other location I would be starting, which sounds like a lie, as I have been training for a month to start in the new location. Now my boss is saying he is not sure how to fit me in the schedule at my regular location, leaving me in a tricky spot. I can't help but feel fooled (or bamboozled for the lack of a better word that I can think of right now) and am wondering if my boss is even allowed to do this? I need the hours and don't know when I'll be getting hours again. I don't appreciate the uncertainty and I feel I should not be held liable for this. What should I do? How should I go about this?",0
"[TX] I slept with a girl who had a boyfriend who has threatened me and been in physical altercations with her... now he has filled my gas tank with salt unprovoked. I have a warrant out in another county and am afraid of being arrested during school if I report the crime. Help?. I hooked up with a girl in a relationship and her ex-boyfriend has been stalking and harassing her and I separately, always appearing at places he thinks we will show up. He has had multiple minor unprovoked physical altercations with her involving lots of yelling in public places with multiple witnesses.

Today I just discovered he has entirely filled my gas tank with salt, which can destroy my car. He told her over the phone that he had already did this a couple weeks ago but had not actually done it at that point... I saw him at a local concert last night and I think it set him off, because I looked in my gas tank today and it is completely full of salt. I also have a text message from a couple weeks ago where he threatens to fight me if I ever talk to him or if he sees me with the girl he was dating (neither of these things have happened but it is still a credible threat).

I would report the crime immediately, but I am in Denton texas and have a warrant out for my arrest in Austin for a class B misdemeanor. I am afraid they will also take me to jail, but I am a student and taking summer classes. Will they take me in for my warrant? Is this sufficient evidence to have him convicted? Are the other altercations enough to file a restraining order? Neither her nor I feel safe in this town anymore because of the things he has been doing. I am an extremely poor student and in dire need of help so any advice is much appreciated.

My tentative plan is to go through all of my classes tomorrow and report the crime regardless of if they arrest me for my warrant or not... but at least I will not miss class, as I have multiple homeworks and quizzes every class day in summer school. Is this a good plan?

Thank you",0
"Unpaid Signed Loan Contract -- Statute of Limitations - Am I Off the Hook?. I am located in New York.

Long story short, about 9 years ago I ended up damaging someone's property (twice!) as a result of two farming equipment accidents. As a result of it, I agreed to pay them $15K to settle their civil cases against me. We signed and notarized the repayment agreement, in which I was supposed to pay a certain amount per month.  A variety of family problems were present and I really didn't have the money, so the person specifically put into the contract that they could grant me reprieves from the agreed upon payment schedule if necessary, but that they had the right to rescind those reprieves at any time for any reason and have me continue upon the normal payment schedule. Basically, if I didn't have money to pay them in August, they could say don't worry about it pay me in September or something like that. After signing the agreement, I had a variety of unforeseen things happen to me, and the person told me don't worry about paying it back right now. I basically never brought it up to them again, moved and hadn't heard about it since. About two months ago, I received a certified letter in the mail from an attorney stating that ""any abeyance in payment is hereby revoked"" and that payment would be expected the following month at the law firm's address, as well as a copy of the signed contract. Having consulted online resources, I determined that the statute of limitations in New York is 6 years and that the contract was well over its effective time and ignored the letter. I just got a second letter from him stating that I was now in default of the agreement and they were prepared to ""file an action"" against me in county court and that according to the agreement and that I was responsible for attorney's fees, etc. unless I immediately corrected the default. I still have not responded.
Am I right that the statute of limitations in New York is 6 years and thus their agreement is worthless?",0
"Tenants are revolting against other tenant accused of a crime. -- Part II. I wanted to start off by thanking everyone who replied to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5ywoop/tenants_are_revolting_against_other_tenant/). I appreciate the advice given to me. 

To give an update of sorts: It turned out that the charges against Joe were dropped a few days after I posted here, the parent apparently coached the child into accuse Joe of molestation because she wasn't comfortable with a man at the daycare center. Unfortunately, the harassment against Joe and his family did not stop after that. Someone tried to break into his apartment in the middle of the night. I decided to install the cameras as was advised, and let Joe out of his lease without penalty. Joe and his family were grateful for this. So they left around two months ago. 

Unfortunately, the other tenants have not calmed down. Now they have turned against me. Someone found out I let Joe out without penalty, and it pissed them all off. I got my apartment tagged with ""FUCK YOU PEDO"". I caught it on film but my tenants were savy to the cameras, and had masks (or stockings) over their faces to prevent their faces from being seen. 

I took this footage to the police but they told me they can't do anything without their faces being shown.

My tenants have been purposefully waiting until the absolute last minute to pay their rent. My newspapers keep being taken. Someone smeared animal feces on my car window. Someone has been taking my mail. It's becoming too much for me and my own family. I sent a certified letter via my attorney to all of them, asking to cut it out. Someone cut up one of the letters and left the bits scattered in front of my door.

My question here is, can I evict all of my tenants? Is that possible?  If I catch them committing crimes, is that enough to convince a judge to removing their tenancy?  I've been logging and photographing as much of the harassment as I could. State is New Jersey.",1
"[USA-PA] Computer damaged by partially melted power supply. I have a fairly high end computer (custom built) that was a few years old. 

Recently I started having lots of issues with it and upon further troubleshooting/inspection noticed some of the modular connections on my power supply were melted.

Oddly enough the machine continued to limp along until I made this discovery.

The power supply is a ""high end"" 1000W and had a 5 year warranty so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement. Was a fairly painless transaction.

My issues persisted even with the new power supply (instability, etc) 

I tried my ram sticks one at a time and the issue continued with all four and so I figured my motherboard had been damaged (in hindsight i should have bought all new ram at the same time)

Being a high end X99 platform it made sense to just replace the motherboard as any kind of an upgrade would be very expensive and not much gain to me as I just use it for office/IT tech work and gaming.

The replacement motherboard did not fix the issue so I started to suspect my ram/processor.

I am awaiting a replacement processor from Intel and new ram from amazon.

I have been in contact with a seemingly helpful/friendly person from the PSU company and had originally shipped them my motherboard for further inspection. I have not yet heard back their diagnosis on the motherboard but regardless I will not be using it again.

I emailed them today and explained everything ive done and money it has cost me and i've asked what they can do for me. 

If they don't offer a reasonable settlement to this matter is it a good idea to sue them in small claims court? I have spent many hours troubleshooting and dealing with this system including loss of productivity at work from having to use my laptop which is not ideal for IT work. 

In hind sight I should have just bought all new components right away after the PSU failure and then tried to work out compensation with them but I opted to try to fix it one part at a time.",0
"[OH] Possible scam rental listing. I've been searching for housing recently and found this place that seemed like a decent deal. First thing that was kind of weird was that the place offered a ""self-guided"" tour in which you schedule a time and the lockbox gives you a code valid for 30 minutes. Strange to me, but it seemed like more of a risk to the property owners than anything else.


Anyways, I took the tour, liked the place, and decided to apply on their website. The specific house didn't show, so I emailed the agency and was told to apply for this other house and they'd transfer the application, as the house I wanted was new enough that they hadn't posted it to their website yet. 


A week or so went by after I submitted the application (with a trove of personal info-- SSN, income information, past addresses...) and then I contacted them again. I was told that, in fact, the place was not actually on the market and that they had messed up.


At this point, I was a little upset and suspicious, but I reasoned that maybe it was really just a rental agency that had no idea what they were doing. 


Just today, however, I found the same place listed on trulia, contacted under a different name, and was able to set up another tour. This has removed most of the doubt that these people are honest; I highly doubt the place has been put on, taken off, and then put on the market again in the span of a month.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So this is likely a scam, but my main question is: is this most probably a scam to promote other listings by the agency (in other words, a shifty advertising/sales strategy) or do I need to take some major identity theft precautions?

The real estate agency in question is True Real Estate Management, which seemed legit enough to me upon some research, but I may be missing something

He immediately accused me of being intoxicated, stating that I had been slurring my words. He had not heard anything out of the ordinary, but an un-named source had reported the ""slurring"" to him. He stated the I did not smell of alcohol, nor did I appear drunk, but he was, ""worried something was going on."" 

  After speaking with him for about 15 minutes, pointing out that I have never had any alcohol on the job (before or during), did not smell of alcohol, and was clearly not drunk. He appeared to agree with me. Moments later, he asked thay I clock out (depriving me of a shift that I desperately need) and leave immediately.

I relieve there may well be no legal recourse here, thought this feels very much like classic defamation, especially considering all of my co-workers were well aware of my manufactured drunkenness. 

If there is nothing I can do, then so be it. I guess I will just be the guy who shows up to work drunk, except I don't, and never would.

"The Garage Door. TL;DR: A private garage door was broken (for a year) which allowed someone to come and break into my car. The landlord responsible for the gate believes she's not liable, I believe she was negligent. I've already filed to sue her. What's my standing?

I live in a condo that I'm renting. There's a tenant living next to me and her landlord (A) who is different than my landlord (B). We have ""private"" garages in the sense that I have two spaces you can park into only if you use my garage door and there's one space using her garage door. Once inside, you can walk to the other person's space without a problem, i.e. it's open space. 

The tenant had informed Landlord A that the garage door wasn't working (due to a lack of sensors?) and had to leave it on manual to open and close it. Landlord A insisted that the tenant fix it because they were the tenant and it was her responsibility. The HOA said it was her responsibility and she didn't fix it for nearly a year. 

I let the HOA do its thing because that's what it's there for. And yet they couldn't get her to do anything for nearly a year. Due to her negligence, someone waltzed right in, broke my car window, and stole something with extreme sentimental value to me that I'll never get back.

I'm suing her on the grounds of negligence and being directly responsible in my bag's disappearance and my car's window damage. Here is my argument in bullet form:

* She was well-informed and told it was her responsibility to fix it asap nearly a year ago.

* She knew about problems like a homeless person using it as storage and a toilet (both piss and shit).

* These are considered private garages, i.e. not shared spaces or an open garage like the rest of the tenants have. Therefore it is not ""park at your own risk.""

* While the broken garage is not her fault, fixing it in a timely manner is and she did not do that. I was not harmed immediately after it was broken, but a year afterwards. I was directly harmed due to her negligence after a timely manner.",1
"Legality of tow away signs in apartment complex? (OHIO). I live in an apartment complex in Ohio and my car was towed on the grounds that it is a private lot and that a permit is needed to park there (which I have, it hangs from the rear view mirror like it should be) you should also know that there was a no parking sign nearby (which I didn't notice at the time, just worked a 13 hour shift, I was tired) but that wasn't the reason for being towed on the report (I called the city and asked, it was just because of the supposed lack of permit). Now, there have been several issues with my apt complex before where they have changed things to fine people more, screw people over, etc which is why I'm asking this question. According to ORC 4513.601 (A) The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign, that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:

(I am not listing a-c, as they do not apply here)

(d) The telephone number and the address of the place from which a towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;

"Bought Oculus Rift and am not satisfied; Oculus refuses to refund against law?. Location: Netherlands

&gt; As per Section 4.4 of our Terms of Service, located [here](https://www.oculus.com/legal/terms-of-service/), we do not provide refunds for opened or used hardware products, so the Rift cannot be returned.

When I told them the Oculus Touch box is still unopened, they replied

"[MI] Effectiveness of reducing/dismissing my traffic ticket?. Hello

I am a college student, and this is my first ticket.

I hit somebody's back corner and then I fell into a ditch, totaling my vehicle.  The other driver only had corner damage on his car.  Nobody was injured.

I received a traffic ticket for failing to stop for assured distance.  I had the cops come to the scene to simply prove that the other driver was not at fault.  I was surprised that I received a ticket.  Later, I learned that calling the cops is not necessary, as long as information is exchanged.  The other driver was not jumping to call the police right away.  I regret involving the police.  I feel that I screwed myself over, beyond what was necessary.  I feel that totaling my car and denting the other guy's car does not call for a citation, especially considering the other guy did not offer to call the police.

I have a pre-trial soon.  I have to talk to a prosecutor and make a deal.  I would ideally like to drop the whole case, as my father's insurance is taking care of vehicle damage.

I am educating myself about courts.  I learned that the prosecutors want to spend more time prosecuting midemeanors/felonies and other serious issues.  They just want to get petty tickets out of the way.

Would it benefit me to ask for my case to be dismissed, and if he doesn't budge, say ""I want to learn more about the court process, so I am going to have trials regarding my ticket, so I can explore all of my options.  I have time because I am out of school for the summer.""

Would this make the prosecutor want to back off and not want to deal with me, especially because I am young.  I have had my liscense for about a year.  I know it costs a lot of money to run the courts.  I recognize that it's assumed that people who hit cars from behind are at fault, but the reality is, traffic court is designed to suck money from people.  The other driver wasn't upset when I talked to him.  I just want the insurance to fix the other guy's car, and move on with my life.",0
"[WI] Landlord not recognizing verbal intentions of moving out, causing problems with other landlords calling for references..     I have a lease with my landlord where she asks for 60 days notice (doesn't' say writing just notice) before moving out.  I had a conversation with the woman 2 1/2 months ago where I told her we were planning on moving out because we wanted to obtain a dog.  Told her very clearly that not being able to have a dog was a serious issue for my wife and I and that we would be ending our lease and moving out upon its end.  
    I originally thought our lease was up in the end of July, in fact it was June and we are currently month to month.  Did not receive a notice about this.  On June 27th I gave her an email in writing explaining we would be moving out.
    She is refusing to cooperate and insists that I did not give her the 60 days notice, but I did.   We are applying to new places and when they called her about references she complained about us being lease breakers and gave us a bad reference.  Also she made some claims about my cat damaging the apartment.  The damage is minimal to the carpet in a section that is very very fixable.   She was sapose to come view the apartment and discuss our options moving forward with these damages and we took time off work to meet her and she never showed up, nor called.
   We are excellent tenants who have never missed a months payment in the 3 1/2 years we have resided there.

She suddenly remembered the conversation I had with her, started studdering her speech and then hung up on me and is refusing to take my calls now.
  I have no idea how to deal with this.  My wife and I need to move to get out of a terrible situation and I was under the impression I was being very professional about this.",1
"(VA) Renting a house - safe to show landlord bank statement?. My brother and I are looking to rent a house from the father of my brother's best friend of about 10 years. Being that neither of us currently has a job (I just graduated from college, and my brother has mostly been doing freelance-type work), the prospective landlord asked us to get our parents to sign a letter indicating that they would be paying our rent until we find jobs.

&amp;nbsp;

While our parents have agreed to pay the first month's rent plus the deposit, they are not willing to sign the letter and become our guarantors. Since I have a substantial amount in savings (more than enough for 2 years of the full rent, so over 4 years of my half of the rent), I asked if I could show him a bank statement in place of getting a signature from our parents. He said that was fine, and to just give it to him along with the rental application he asked us to fill out.

I'm wondering what steps I should take, if any, to protect myself, legally speaking. **I printed out my statement showing my name, address, account numbers (checking and savings), and balances. Is there any of this information that I should black out so that he can't see?** Also, I have only printed out the first page showing the most recent month's account balances, not the actual transaction history - not sure what exactly I should/shouldn't give him. I really, realllllly don't expect him to use this information in a malicious way (he is a 72-year old man with a flip phone, after all), but I was just wondering if it is possible that someone could piece together enough information from a bank statement  and potentially take my money/identity/whatever. I just can't think of any other way to get him to agree to rent to us. We need to move in the next month, and the rent is significantly cheaper than similar houses in the area, so we really do want this specific house. Plus, I'm not sure that anyone who didn't already know us would be willing to rent to us given our lack of employment history.",1
"What to do when you discover someone (probably) plagiarized your website content? Location: Internet. [X-Post from r/blogging]. I just noticed that another website probably copied one of my site's more popular posts (responsible for about 20% of my traffic). Right now, my post is n1 for a certain search term on google (at least when I search) and theirs is n5. Now, I can't be sure or proof they copied me, because it's something anyone could come up with after a bit of research, but I believe so because:

- The content and structure is very similar, they just consolidated some points and point to their service at the end.

- It's dated a few months after I posted mine and there was no similar content before. There are some other posts on the same subject dated after mine, but at least they don't look so similar / brought in another perspective

- This particular post/guide is relatively out-of-niche for them, while my site centers around that topic. They just bent and twisted it to make it relevant to their service.

- I link to their service in some of my site because I find it very useful. This leads me to suspect they found my site as a source of steady referral traffic (after I wrote them an email asking if it was okay to link to them and they agreed), found the post in question and noticed they could copy it and use it for their own gains. This kinda adds insult to injury.

Now since I can't proof anything I don't want to throw around accusations, but it all seems pretty clear to me. I'm placed higher on google, so I doubt I'm losing too much traffic to them because of this, though it may be some, but it's more about the principle. I link to their site because I like their service and recommend it to my readers, and they steal my content and a chunk of traffic.

So, what do you think I can/should do about this?

My first instinct was to write them an email, politely requesting they link to my site since its contents my interest their readers of that particular article, but maybe you have a better idea?

Thanks in advance for your input :-)",0
"Couple Immigration to the USA - Many questions. [UK/HK]. We were hoping to ask anyone with good knowledge on US immigration law on how we should proceed as a couple? I [20F] was born in the USA [MO] and have a passport, birth certificate and a SSN but moved when I was just a baby. I do not have family in the USA and don't have established residency in any state. 

My partner [23M] was born in the UK and we now want to eventually move to the USA. However, I feel like I'm currently too young to get married and will probably be aiming to get married in 2-4 years.  I will be moving home to Hong Kong this year whilst he will be staying in the UK to finish the final year in his degree. 


1) My partner wants to know how he can live and work in the USA legally without a marriage green card/visa. We are looking into him getting a masters in the USA as we know some masters courses allow their graduates to stay in the country to find work for the next 3 years but we know that chances of scholarships are slim. 


2) I have read about how it is easier to get the marriage green card if he was already in the states at the time. Would him not being in the USA when applying for the green card/visa be a detriment?


3) Is it possible to get a marriage visa/green card if we got married outside of the USA and **both** parties are not present in the USA at the time of the application and will this affect his ability to enter the country? 


4) My partner also wants to know if it's possible for him to eventually get a dual citizenship between UK/USA?


We have several other options ranging from him getting a masters in the USA, getting a masters in Hong Kong where grants and scholarships are much easier to get (and he can live with me), or him working in the UK for a few years whilst we get our act together. We are just very confused as to how the whole process of immigration works and the requirements for it. 

TLDR - Boy and girl want to move to America to live the American dream. Girl is American by birth but doesn't live there and boy is from UK. How this work?",0
"Messed up developer-controlled condo, Massachusetts.. So I bought a condo, Massachusetts, back in 2012 (worst decision I’ve made to date).  Only 2 units were built, one building townhouse style.  The second unit sold shortly after.  The developer still has not built anymore units (leaving it about 95% unfinished) and gets in trouble with the city every time he tries (ignoring wetland issues and cease and desist orders).  He periodically lists the development for sale but no one has bought it.  I, with the other unit owner, take care of plowing and general maintenance.  The developer no longer collects dues from us and just leaves us be.  I haven’t heard from him in about a year now.

Not sure what lead me to check out title of the property but it looks like a mess. There are all these quitclaim deeds to Nevada corporations this guy has set up, sometimes for $1 and sometimes for more.  Back and forth and now a deed clarification of some other corporation saying that they have the valid title.  This new corporation, while previously created by our developer, doesn’t look like it is owned by him anymore.  From what I can tell, the property has been passed around for shares in these corporations.  I spent half a day in google digging up all sorts of stuff I didn’t want to know and didn't really understand.

So not even sure if our developer is even our developer anymore.

What kind of mess is this and how do I protect myself?  I eventually want to be able to sell, but my gut says that won’t be possible.  And I feel bad about unloading this on to some other clueless buyer.  Besides not being able to sell, is there any other way this could come bite me?  Can he, the developer, even pass around the land like this?  Could my mortgage be called due?  Doesn’t he, the developer, need to let the unit owners know about these things?  I’m so in the dark. 

I feel like I need a lawyer to look at all the facts and look out for my best interests … but it’s such a muck I don’t even know what kind of lawyer to look for or what needs protecting.",1
"MA - Lease gone bad, landlocked washer and dryer.. Hi, apologize for the slightly click bait title, but I know how much this sub loves landlocked issues, if absolutely necessary I can put together a rough MS paint sketch. I'm hoping some people here can give me some advice.  I will try to keep the details short, location is Massachusetts. 

I had an apartment I was waiting to sign the lease for, prior to signing the lease I arranged to buy the washer and dryer from the people moving out and I sent them money for it ($200, not the end of the world).  Prior to signing the lease, things went south with the landlord. After talking to the prior tenants that we bought the washer dryer from, we learned she(landlord) has a history of mental health issues that they were well aware of.  The landlord has said she is going to return our deposit so no issue there, the issue is with the washer and dryer currently inside the apartment that I don't have a lease for. 

My relationship with the landlord is pretty much gone, and I don't need the washer and dryer, so I would if possible like to avoid trying to have to arrange to go in and get them and transport them. My thought/opinion is that there is an element of consideration between the prior tenants and myself, that the washer and dryer were bought on the implication that we would be moving into that apartment, we no longer are, and they could have likely foreseen something like this happening.  Further it would be significantly easier for them to deal with selling it to the next tenants as they still have an amicable relationship with the landlord.  At the very least, should they resist fully in refunding me, they should be responsible for getting the washer and dryer out of the apartment (essentially delivering it to me in a very basic sense) as I assume I have very little legal grounds to go in and get it.  

This all just happened last night so no action has been taken, I'm just wondering if anyone agrees with my thought process and if I have any leg to stand on so-to-speak in negotiating the washer/dryer.",1
"Deadbeat Dad is trying to get split custody. Washington State.. Hello!

My wife and I have been married almost 1 year, but together for 5 years. We have had our 6 year old living with us since she was 1. It was established verbally that her father has seen her every other weekend and paying 500$ a month for child support. For years and years he never really paid consistent child support or was there emotionally there for her. We have done completely everything and she is everything to us. In the past 6 months he has paid 200$ of child support so he told us about his financial troubles about his car getting reposed and he asked me to adopt his child. I knew this was an easy way for him to get out of child support but I didn't hesitate to look it the process of adoption, but 2 weeks later he changed his mind. We decided to submit to the state that we would like to establish child support so he has to pay through the state. It seems like since he found out about this he has now served us papers so he can have split custody. I work on base and am going to talk to the JAG and hire an attorney, because we don't want to risk anything. We have text messages talking about the adoption, to his financial troubles. My wife is bipolar and he used her illness in the papers saying she is not stable enough to raise children, and he also stated that we are withholding his daughter from him. Her illness is managed completely and we felt like it was a low ball. We have a house on 4 acres of land and he lives with his girlfriend in an apartment. He has never taken her to school or taken her to a doctors appointment. We live in the state of Washington and I am active duty in the United States Air Force.

Sorry if anything is difficult to read as I am just recently transitioning from graveyard work.

What are some factors that could allow him split custody?

Sorry, just stressed out about this. We don't know how this stuff works. Yes we are seeing an attorney we just want to know if others have been through this.

Advice?

"Internet fraud?. I own an SEO company and we do legit work.  We have been in this space since 2007 and have had 0 complaints and no chargebacks.

A while ago we were hired by a company that we were unsure if we wanted to work with for $1,500 per month (the guy had a bad attitude and was very rude).  We explained that results may take between 4 to 6 months and sometimes longer and he agreed.  He also signed our contract that has the terms of work and no refunds or guarantees of page 1 results. 

2 weeks into the project he begins asking about results and we tell him it takes 4 to 6 months..  He agrees and is happy and content.  4 weeks in he again asks about results and again we tell him 4 to 6 months..  He pays a second month and tells us we are doing a great job.  

After 3 months and $4,500 with the client calls us up and says no is angry with our work and wants to cancel his service.  We told him we have a 30 day policy but not a problem he is free to leave with out any additional money owed to us.

Then he initiated chargebacks with his credit card company for the payments he made to us.  We have never had to deal with this issue before so we contacted the processor and we filed our disputer paper work and we won due to proof of work done and the contract he signed.

He is now threatening to report us to ic3.gov , leave bad reviews, and file criminal charges against us for ""fraud"" if we do not return all his money..  

My lawyer is out of town and unavailable until next Friday due to being on vacation so I am waiting on his reply to me but this guy wants an answer NOW or else he said he is moving forward with his complaints.  

We have never had any complaints, issues and we did nothing wrong..  His main complaint is we outsourced work (we did not) and we did not provide results to his website.

We are based in the USA if that matters for the advice.

Thanks for your time in reading, i hope you can help.

"[Ontario, Canada] Employment contract that seems kind of sketchy. Hi, I just got hired at a bar a couple of weeks ago, and I was asked to sign an employment contract that contained a couple of clauses that I'm a bit apprehensive about. I've worked at many bars and restaurants over the years and I've never had to sign anything like this before, and I'm just wondering what other folks might think before I sign the contract. 

The things that stood out to me were:
- ""Probation: The first six months of employment are a probationary period during which Employer may, in its sole discretion and for any reason, terminate employment without further compensation, notice, pay in lieu of notice, and severance"". I assume this part is probably legal, but I don't find comfort in knowing that I could be terminated for any reason without notice for the first six months...
- ""Confidential Information - you will not at any time divulge, disclose, or communicate to any individual, person, firm, corporation, partnership, or business entity of any time, any information concerning any matter affecting or relating to Employer's enterprise, including business records, business events, daily matters, marketing, operations procedures, passwords, food and beverage development and recipes, menu development, and any financial or business affairs connected thereto.

"[New York] Denied backdated health insurance and now have an appeal (and a medical/dental condition). Would love advice/guidance!. TL;DR- Got lost in the health insurance system due to a glitch; now have a wisdom tooth tearing up my mouth and want to know if it's okay to get medical help despite being in an appeal process 

So! Back in December of 2016, I applied for health insurance via NY State of Health and uploaded my tax returns as proof of income (I'm freelance). I was then told I hadn't given enough information of proof of income despite uploading my tax return, so called the phone line to ask what more I needed to do. They told me tax documents were enough, it was a glitch in their system, and they would contact me when it was all settled. In February I hadn't heard from them yet, so called again to check in---was told once again that it was a glitch and they would contact me shortly.

Fast forward to now--I still hadn't heard from them, but apparently have a wisdom tooth that decided to show up in my mouth last week and wreck havoc (constant pain, hard to eat, hurts to swallow, all that fun stuff). I called the office again to check in, was told it was a massive error on their part and they got me set up to pick a plan (which I did), except it doesn't start until August--I cannot make it much longer like this, one week has already been hell. I then requested to file for backdating due to an urgent medical need, which was denied (not sure why entirely, more than willing to call and ask for specifics if that's helpful). 

I can expand on all of this further if the wall of text hasn't already been a turn off, but the basic questions I have are:

-now that I'm filing an appeal, is it okay to still get my tooth removed or does that hurt my standing in the appeal process?

-if I win this appeal will I be reimbursed for whatever costs my dental would've covered (if it's kosher to remove the tooth)?

-is it terribly stupid to not have someone to represent me for this telephone hearing?

Thank you for any/all help and hope everyone is having a wonderful Sunday!",0
"[California - Family Law] Can I (or should I) change the asset allocation of investments under a property division dispute?. Hello,

Exwife and I have been caught in a contentious, nasty divorce for nearly two years now.  Since 2014 I haven't changed the asset allocation of my investments.  She has claimed a much larger share of these as common property.  Her attorney has claimed my separate property became commingled.  I have so far made a partial tracing, which I believe is accurate (because opposing counsel has so far avoided mentioning it).  I was concerned about overexposition to the stock market, and asked my wife in late 2015 to make changes.  She ignored my request. 

I made a new declaration of disclosure last february.  I'm becoming increasingly nervous because opposing side is asking for specific quantities, instead of a reasoned request for a specific number of shares or a percentage, as I've asked them.  I would like to convert some of the investments under dispute into cash or at least move them into less risky investments.  My attorney insists I should not do that, as it might look bad before the judge and I'll become liable for any cap gains tax. 

I feel overburdened because while my exwife claims a sizeable share of these funds, she has completely ignored anything related to stewardship.  If the stock market makes a downturn, the other side might as well make me responsible for mismanagement and make their demands based on last February's valuation.

Exwife and attorney have successfully delayed the case for a while now, asking for more paperwork every time, pretending to be unavailable, or absent from the country, or that they didn't receive anything, and so on.  Judge so far has done nothing for me other than set up a mandatory conference..., in two months..., just to hear what paperwork the new judge wants to see.  Legal costs just keep mounting and I'm already forced to convert investments into cash to pay for my attorney.  My own expenses, alimony, and attorney fees exceed well over 50% my net pay on a monthly basis.

"Needing advice regarding a speeding ticket and a difficult municipal court in Texas please. In early May, I got a speeding ticket in Magnolia, Texas. According to the ticket, I'm entitled to the evidence against me. I also could not make my assigned court date due to work conflicts. I sent the Municipal court a letter requesting evidence and a court date conflict. Never heard back. Court says letter never arrived, and now my ticket is in 'default' cause I didn't showed up for my date.  
  
I sent a second letter, certified, via USPS. Tracking number says it made it the Magnolia post office, but after being 'out for delivery' for ten days, the post office opens an investigation. They tell me that because of the huge volume of mail going to the court, not all of it gets scanned. 
A clerk at the court cannot locate the letter. They tell me to get a DVD of my ticketing incident, I have to submit a written claim in order for them to send me the form to request the evidence. They cannot accept the request over the phone.   
  
I call a lawyer for help at the end of June. He tells me I may have a warrant out for my arrest now, and that my fines may have gone up. Offers to call the court on my behalf to see what's going on, and to see if they'll accept a fax instead. Is unable to get a hold of them for three days. Oh, and he keeps forgetting to call me back.  I've given up on him.  
  
I sent a third letter via UPS earlier in July, which *was* filed as delivered. I've been calling the Court three-four times a day for four days now, and I cannot get anyone on the phone to confirm they actually have it.   
  
It's now been two months since my ticket. I'm going insane, and I don't know what to do. I haven't received any mail from the Court. I feel the ticket was predatory, and I don't want to spend $250 for allegedly going 51 miles per hour from a stopped position in less than one mile of travel time. I don't live in Texas, which makes my options limited.  
  
Can I file a complaint against the court? Because this is a fairly rural area, ticket lawyers are really hard to find.",0
"[Ontario, CA] Have a ticket for an unsafe lane change. Early resolution is later today need advice-thank you in advance. I was in an accident a few months ago. I was on a provincial highway and I entered a 2 lane roundabout. This was my first time driving in one as I have only had my license for 3 years and I just never came across one. I accidentally entered in the outside lane not realizing I needed to be on the inside lane. I intended to go all the way around the roundabout and there was a large truck (I drive a mini hatchback) to my left on the inner lane of the roundabout who decided to exit. He saw me and still decided to just exit and slammed directly into my driver side.

Police arrived on scene and because I was in the wrong lane (unknowingly) even though he was supposed to be looking out for other vehicles I was the only one who got a ticket for an ""unsafe lane change"" because technically I was in the lane that was supposed to exit. So although I didn't actually change lanes I remained in the roundabout when I should have exited. 

Its all very confusing. But I know on the accident report it says that I say I did NOT see the truck and the guy driving the truck says he DID see me. So I feel like he has some culpability and in fact he is the one who made an unsafe lane change because he didn't bother to check for other vehicles around him before exiting the roundabout. 

I understand I was in the wrong lane and that's totally my fault but at the same time I wasn't intentionally being unsafe and I didn't make a lane change unsafely I just didn't realize I was supposed to exit if I was in the outside lane. 

My early resolution meeting is today and honestly I cannot afford a ticket like this. I'm a single mom, I work 3 jobs, and attend school. I have been told that they cannot convict me if they can't prove the exact offense on the ticket. But I'm not sure what to say at this early resolution meeting I have today.

Also want to make mention that this is a ticket for a provincial highway under the highway traffic act. 

Any advice is very much appreciated. Thank you.",0
"Emotional Support Animal - Now a threat to be Evicted. Hello all, kind of an extension to a previous post. 

Recently, my roommates and I signed a lease and moved into an apartment that has a no pet policy. However, my roommate has an Emotional Support Animal (ESA) that has documentation for given to her by a licensed therapist in the state via telemedicine. We have done research, and found that we do not need to disclose an ESA to our landlord (correct me if I am wrong) under the Fair Housing Act. 

Upon noticing that there was a dog in the unit, the landlord gave us a 3 day notice to cure our ""breach."" My roommate then gave our landlord the letter stating that the dog spotted was an Emotional Support Animal. Even after my roommate sent the letter to our landlord, our landlord asked that we either get rid of the dog, or we will be given an eviction notice. He stated that there is an ""undue burden"" due to having the dog, for the reason that under CA State Law, he must disclose that there was a dog living in the unit to future tenants, possibly harming future business. Is this true?
Following this, he also stated that his attorney told him that we signed a contract under ""false pretenses,"" given that we moved in with a dog, and that this would override any discrimination to an individual with an ESA. 

We have found a place for the dog to stay in the meantime, and want to bring the dog back, as it provides my roommate with the support needed to live not only in the apartment comfortably, but in the college town we live in. To appease our landlord, we have cured our breach. Even after sending him the letter, he told me that 1 of his supposedly 8 attorneys wanted to move forward with an eviction given we did not have the dog off the premise. 

We have submitted a complaint to HUD, hoping that the fact that ESAs do not have to be disclosed upfront will help us out, and that our landlord's action is discriminatory. 

Also, the lease specifies that PETS are not allowed. Because this is an ESA, not a pet, were we ever in breach?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you.",1
"Abandon property under federal forfeiture. Hey Reddit,

I'm currently in a really sticky position and need some help on climbing out of this situation.

I currently have a house which has me and my mother's name in the deed and is fully paid off. 2 years ago, the DEA raided my home because of something my father was doing. A few months after the raid, the government released a document which indicted a bunch of people. Under that notice, our home was ""subject to forfeiture"" and they put on lien on the home. 

At the moment, my father is nowhere to be found and considered on the run. I have talked to some lawyers a while ago and they said it may be years (upwards to 10 years) before anything happens to the home. So right now it's sitting there and we can't do anything with it. My brother is currently living there along with my mom. 

Here's the problem now. I currently live paycheck to paycheck and can not afford the property taxes. With the current late fee's, it has gone from ~$7000 to $10000. I currently don't live in the home and live a few cities away. I was under the assumption that my mother was going to pay for the property taxes alongside my brother since they are living in the home, but that's not the case. My brother works as a server and my mother does not do anything. I brought up the matter to my mother today when I found out the property taxes were not being taken care of and she basically told me ""Not my problem"". She doesn't care about her credit or the repercussions of what this could do to me.

I'm now stuck with a piece of property that I cannot do anything with and cannot afford the property taxes. It will go up to $12,000 by the end of this year and then the new taxes for 2017 will be around $7500 on top of that.

Is there any way I can abandon the property or give up my portion or convince her to give up both of our portions to whatever government agency so we can just get it off our hands and be done with the fucking stress that comes from it? We can't afford to fight this case against the federal government and it will be years before anything happens.",1
"(FL) Injured on hospital grounds - are they liable for medical bills incurred at same hospital?. Some months back I witnessed a bad motorcycle accident that happened at the intersection entrance to the local hospital. I honestly thought the motorcycle driver was going to die because I saw the impact and his body fly through the air and land head first on the pavement (he didn't die, just in case you wonder). I was very freaked out and got out of my car and ran over to him. Another person had just gotten to him and yelled for me to go get help, so I did - I just blindly ran without thinking beyond I needed to get someone at the hospital to come help him. The direction I ran in had a decorative metal picket fence that surrounded some bushes (this was on the hospital grounds). In my panic I went over the fence instead of taking the extra time to run back and go around it.

When I went over the fence one of the metal pickets caught on my hand and sliced open the skin between two of my fingers. I got help, went back, met with the police and gave a witness statement, and then a doctor who had come out to see what was happening noticed my hand was pouring out blood and said to go to the emergency room and they'd 'take care of me.' So I went to ER and told them my story, and then told the doctor who gave me stitches and a tetanus shot, and then told the guy who came out afterwards from billing. He asked at some point if 'this is a liability thing,' and I said I didn't know and just told him what happened. He changed the subject and then took my card to charge my co-pay. Some weeks after I received a bill for another $149 that my insurance didn't pay. 

My question is - is this 'a liability thing'? Should the hospital waive this bill or not? I tried looking up the relevant laws and didn't understand enough to know what to think. I tried calling the hospital's risk management department but they didn't return my 2 calls. I don't want any money from them, I just don't want to pay this $149. Also, if it is 'a liability thing' what would happen with the payment my insurance made? Thank you!",0
"Young adult may need to take guardianship of autistic brother. Hi all,

I located in Iowa, am a young adult and will finish college in December. 

I am coming to accept that I will not be able to flee the state after graduation. In short, I do not believe my father and mother are capable of caring for my slightly younger brother with Asperger Syndrome. They failed to do basically anything at all until he turned 18, are too immature themselves and essentially throw tantrums in response to his tantrums, provide little structure in his life and my mother has this idea now that antidepressants will magically make my brother a functioning person.

I think my brothers social abilities have decreased and his anger has increased since he finished high school (he was pushed through with the help of an assistant and my parents basically doing his homework for him) and his social interaction has been more limited to our parents.

He currently lives at home, is over the age of 18 and no one has anytime of legal guardianship over him or his affairs. He is also not enrolled in medicaid, though he does have health insurance through my parents until the age of 26. 

I think that for his well being it is necessary we get legal guardianship over him and have him enrolled in medicaid. Ideally, I think it would be best that I have guardianship over him as my parents have a track record of not being fit to address his needs (we have NO extended family). But, I will not make a lot (if any) money out of college, especially if I stay in this state, and I myself may depend on my parents, who have some money, to live. My goal would be to get him behavioral and life skill therapy and into an assisted living situation.. whether in this state or in another state that has better options. 

I am willing to dedicate a few years of my life to this task, but I don't know if its even possible, and I can't afford a lawyer. Please if you have answers or resources on applying for guardianship and medicaid, let me know! Also, if you have any advice on convincing a judge that I am the most fit person to care for him, help!",0
"New development across the street has created a tremendous amount of runoff that led to a large amount of silt being deposited on my parents' property.. We live on a lake in North Carolina where a development is going in across the street. Our driveway is directly across from one of the entrances to this new subdivision, which is mostly finished except for maybe 20 or so houses on the side of the subdivision closest to us. We had about 2.25 inches of rainfall in an hour or so yesterday which lead to a very large amount of silt deposited in our flower beds, in front of our garage door (some inside the garage), around the back of the house under our deck, etc etc. A large amount of debris traveled with the water and much of our mulch has been carried away.

As far as I can tell, the rainwater washed into the development's street, past the silt fences, quickly clogged the storm drains (because of the silt catchers they place in the drains), and then ran straight down the street, across the road between our house and the subdivision, and then down our driveway. I ran into the developer today who fed me a line about the gas company destroying the silt fence and not fixing it properly and how he's going to see if they'll fix it and clean up the silt for us. He was very clear that he's not going to take responsibility for the runoff because ""it was a 1,000-year rain that won't happen again"", and apparently other houses had mulch washed away (which I see no evidence of). He's going to send his guys out to start cleaning up the silt, but he won't pay for any landscaping because the water would have done that anyway. Which, of course, is complete BS because the silt clogged the storm drains. It seems to us, based on previous storms, that the installed drainage is not sufficient to deal with the runoff created by the subdivision. Whether or not it will get better once all of the houses are built and grass starts to grow, I can't say. 

I would greatly appreciate some guidance on where to go from here? Contact our home insurer? Contact the county? There has to be a precedent for this.

Thank you.",1
"UK: Landlord infringement of my right to Quiet Enjoyment. What % of rent should I ask for/sue for?. I recently had to move out of a rented flat because the landlord wanted to completely refurbish the building and sell the individual flats. I was given the required notice period. Soon after being given notice, the landlord's contractors began putting up scaffolding (very noisy). I was quite surprised at this, because I hadn't been told the work would be starting while I was still in the building. 

I contacted the Tenancy Relations dept at my local council to check whether the landlord could actually proceed with such major renovations with tenants still in situ. They said yes (subject to safety laws), but I might wish to ask for (or sue for) compensation for the infringement of my right to Quiet Enjoyment of the premises. They suggested I ask for 25% off, and consider settling for less.

I had a meeting with the landlord while the scaffolding was still being put up, and before the interior work started on the empty flats. I mentioned the right to Quiet Enjoyment and asked whether he was considering making an offer of a rent reduction. He said he was not obliged to.

The work on the interior of the building started fairly soon after the scaffolding was up. It was incredibly noisy and produced a huge amount of dust. The contractors were ripping out cupboards, breaking tiles, removing floor and ceiling material, and smashing down interior walls with sledgehammers. All of this material was then removed via the windows and brought down the scaffolding, since the interior staircase couldn't be used while tenants were still in the building.

In short, it became a living hell to live there, not least because I usually work from home and it became impossible to do so. The contractors worked a six day week.

25% off seems very low to me, considering the amount of disruption to my life that the work caused. 

Has anyone got experience of making a claim in the UK for infringement of the right to Quiet Enjoyment? How much can I ask for? North of 50% seems fair to me. Will a small claims judge agree?",1
"[Québec] Buying FSBO House - Closing in 3 days, House Looks Like Foreclosure. To keep things simple, my family and I bought a house in Québec back in May with a closing date of this coming week. We saw the house, loved it, put the offer in with the only inclusions being the air conditioners, dish washer, clothes washer and dryer, and a the hot tub. We went back to Ontario and sold our house and begun the process. The house we bought was listed with a For Sale by Owner type company, the sellers are contractors who build houses and sell them, and built this house to live in, and now sold it to build something new.

We went to 'see' the house today, which was just to drop off our moving truck until Wednesday closing. The house looks like a foreclosure. The grass hasn't been cut in weeks, the entire front of the house is covered in tall weeds and plans, almost obstructing the view from down the street. The backyard is also filled with weeds, un-kept, and the hot sub is almost engulfed in plant-life. 

They've also left a children's play set (large wooden thing), large construction tires (I guess as play toys for their kids), a large metal swing, broken wooden shipping pallets, and other garbage around the exterior of the house. The interior looks terrible also, but I give them the benefit of the doubt that perhaps they moved the furniture today and will be going back to clean the inside before Wednesday.

We emailed the seller to say we are want the exterior garbage removed, and to state our displeasure with the current abandoned look of the property. Our problem is this, Notaries deal with houses in Québec and don't work on behalf of the buyer (us), so what do we do when Wednesday comes along and the house looks like a bank foreclosure and the cost to remove the trash and re-landscape could cost over $10,000? We've been living in a hotel for a week, all of our belongings are either in a truck or our hotel room. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as we're really feeling like we're being screwed around here because we're out of province buyers and will be stuck with a wreck of a house.",1
"[CA] Tenant Landlord Dispute (Unlawful Detainer &amp; Notice to Enter Premises). I have been in my current apartment for over 13 months.

My lease expired at the end of May, and at that time the property was transferred to a new owner.  Management team was kept the same but transferred employment to the new management company.

At the end of May, all apartment tenants had a lease modification/signing.  At my appointed office time for signing, I was informed that my paperwork ""was not ready yet"".  This is the very last I heard from management regarding this matter.

In early June, I opened a HUD claim alleging discrimination due to encounters and I have had with the property manager.

At the end of June, management filed a lawsuit of Unlawful Detainer, alleging me of unpaid rent for the months of May and June.  Management has even falsified a Pay up or Quit notice, allegedly placing it on my door at the end of June.

On July 1st (before I was aware of any lawsuit and or allegations of unpaid rent), I paid July's rent in full.

On July 4th, I was served notice of the Unlawful Detainer lawsuit.

I have paid all my rent by money order, placing payment through the drop slot in the business office.  I do not have my money order receipts (lesson learned) but am working with management at the stores at which I purchased the money orders, hoping they will be able to locate my purchase transaction.

After having the Plaintiff served with my response to the Unlawful Detainer, I have now been given a Notice of Intent to Enter Premises (on July 17th).

After reviewing California Civil Code, it seems the only reasons for property management to enter an occupied rental are the following:

- Emergencies
- Abandonment by tenant
- Repairs and inspection of repairs
- Showing of unit to potential renters/owners

I suspect this is more retaliation on behalf of the manager, as they are now informed that I am fighting the allegations of Unlawful Detainer, and filing complaints with Housing and Urban Development.

As none of the reasons for entry apply to me, how do I stand my ground and deny them entry based on legality?",1
"Camp not paying for teaching services- what's my next step?. I am a certified teacher and was offered a position teaching at a performance arts summer camp for 5 weeks for 2k. I could bring my child so it was really ideal for summer pay. Since taking the position, basically everything has turned out to be a lie. I was supposed to teach Pre-K. Instead I'm teaching PreK-2nd grade all in one classroom.

Okay cool, part of being a teacher is being flexible and making it work- I can do that. Also the number of campers was supposed to be 100, and instead there's 45 at best. We're also in a low socioeconomic area in my city where many of the parents just haven't paid and we're finishing week 3.

Payday is supposed to be this Friday with half of my pay due. I wasn't feeling very confident about her reliability with paying so I asked her today. She basically said she doesn't have it but has around 1/3 of it. Meanwhile we started with around 6 teachers and are now down to only 2 because everyone else has quit or was told the camp was ""closing"" because basically she couldn't afford to pay them.

If she doesn't pay Friday, I'm done. Both myself and the other remaining teacher will not be returning if she doesn't pay us. I've been flexible with a smile on my face and she's so worried about a final performance that it's literally trumping the fact that half the kids in the main roles haven't even paid to come to camp. What are my next steps to get paid if she can't pay us on Friday?

I'm also super frustrated because on the 4th she actually text me and said she was sorry but camp was closing (in reality she knew she couldn't afford to pay me). Then proceeded to ask me to come back 2 days later after I had asked my previous place of employment if I could be added to their schedule a few days a week. So now I feel like a fool but I really love the kids... help! :(

Tldr; I've been teaching at a camp that has basically turned out to be complete lies. I've taught for 3 weeks and now that we're nearing 1/2 of the pay days she ""doesn't know if she can come up with it"". What are my next steps if she says she can't pay me?",0
"My parents' tenant is threatening to sue.. In our rental unit, the tenants just now (back in April) renewed the lease, but then in May they decided they wanted to move and break the lease because of the rent, even though my parents didn't increase the rent. According to our lease, we require a 60 day notice, but they insisted on moving out by July 1st, so they gave us a 30 day signed notice that stated that they will pay the month of June's rent, and we can keep the security deposit because they are breaking the lease with such short notice. My parents didn't agree to the terms because of the short notice, so they then threatened us by stating they already took legal action against us for lying. My parents decided to avoid problems and just let them break the lease with a 30 day notice, so they sent us a new written notice that states we can keep the security deposit and no further additional charges or actions will be taken. They did not state explicitly whether or not they will be paying June's rent in this notice like they did in the first notice, and my parents signed off. They stayed the entire month of June, giving us the key July 1st, without paying rent for the month of June. My parents sent the fact that they didn't pay June's rent into collection through a third party debt collectors. Once they got the notice, they are stating that we agreed on keeping the security deposit as June's rent (no where did we agree on that in writing or orally), and now they are suing us 3x the rent for slander (apparently our reference to their new landlords cause them a loss of 1000$), not making repairs (our lease states we need a written form for repairs and they never sent us one), and overall stress accumulated through the process. They are also claiming that they have written statements from our neighbors that we did the same thing to our last tenant (we didn't and we have proof), and they keep stating that they will see us in court with their attorney. Do they have any chance of winning with what they claim? My parents are very stressed and scared, because this is their first time in this kind of situation.",1
"Non-compete clauses and moving to a direct competitor.... I've been working at a small startup (UK) for about a year now and I've been pretty unhappy for a while so I decided to look elsewhere. I am considering working for a direct competitor.

My boss and I work very closely, and we both acknowledge that we do not get along. The idea of me departing has been discussed and it would not be a shock if I resigned.

In my search for jobs that suit my skill-set, I found a position identical to mine at a direct competitor. It is at a huge organisation, *pays 1.5x the salary*, and offers more opportunity to grow in my career. To be honest it's a dream job. 

After interviewing, I'm optimistic that I'll get an offer in the next week or so. However his got me thinking about non-compete, considering we make essentially the exact same product for the same broad market.

**About my contract**:
The clauses in my employment contract very clearly **prohibit me from dealing with any customer, employee, third party or business for 6 months after termination or divulging any trade secrets or confidential information.** The terms are really broad but very clear. *There is a 3 month prohibition on being involved with 'any business concern' in competition.*

It also states that I must notify my employer if an offer from another company is made, and that I have to give the new employer a copy of my non-compete. 

I could go on 'garden leave' for 3 months but it is extremely unlikely my potential employer would wait that long.

In terms of 'trade secrets,' I know the company's financials *roughly*, and information about the number of customers we have. I don't know if they count as trade secrets. 

**Questions**:
* How serious is this?
* Do I just go ahead and hope nothing comes of it?
* Is there a legal way to go around this?
* How costly and complicated would coming after me be? (My boss is lazy and disorganised)
* Could this get my future employer in trouble/put them off hiring me?

**TL;DR - Hate my job - could go work for an exciting competitor, in the same role. Worried that my non-compete clause may fuck everything up.**",0
"Landlord wants us to deal with her boyfriend (NY). This could be a long post, so my apologies from the start...

Back in February, my wife and I had an amazing housing opportunity fall into our lap - our landlady was moving out of her home, and offered it to us at a steep discount.  Due to some unpleasantness with a divorce and other factors, she still uses this address for shipping and correspondence.  We knew that things were messy for her financially, and she informed us that she was putting the house on the market, although asking far above the actual value of the house.

About a week ago, we received a notice in the mail, addressed to ""occupant"" from a law firm.  It was a notice regarding the foreclosure of the home, and that the house would be going up for auction shortly.  

At the end of the day, this actually worked out (surprisingly) with our overall plans to move anyways.  My wife drafted a notice to vacate and emailed it to the landlord, informing her that we will be moving out and will be using the last month's rent we provided her upon signing the lease, and would like our security deposit returned.  

Minutes after she read the notice, both my wife and I were bombarded by calls from the landlord's boyfriend; since we both were working, we were unable to answer.  He then sent a number of text messages to my wife demanding that we speak.  My wife told him that, because he has no legal stake in the house, we would not discuss anything with him without the landlord being present.

Late last night, the landlord texted my wife, and said that she would not speak to us about anything, and that any discussions would be with the boyfriend.  The thing is, there really isn't anything to discuss - we have to move out, and the house is not hers to control at this point.

We do not feel comfortable with this situation at all.  The boyfriend is a bit of a bully, and it seems like there is not much to discuss - even if we were leaving of our own freewill, we are providing ample notice, and we simply want the person with whom we signed a legal agreement to be the point of contact.  What can we do to ensure that?",1
"Ex-roommate did not pay last months rent to me -- her name is on lease and I want to pursue small claims. Hi! 
Need a little bit of advice here. I was living with 3 girls for 1.5 years. All of our names are on the signed lease and for the first 9 months there was little to no conflict. After a couple incidents with one of the roommates we quickly became a 2 v 1 situation in which we did not like the 3rd girl (she honestly showed some pathological liar tendencies and tries to get money for everything in prior incidents but I didn't become alarmed right away). We finally arrive to the last 2 months of our lease and ended up purchasing a home. Back story of rent/bills was that I would pay rent/cable prior to the 1st of every month, and this girl would pay for electricity and gas. We would deduct her amount and she would Venmo me the remaining (usually around $515-$580 per month) and the other roommate would pay us accordingly. The last month she decided to move out 25 days early. I asked her repeatedly for rent money and at first she said after she paid her final utilities but then she stated on my 4th try of getting her to pay that she would not be paying rent or cable ($604 in total) and that we ""bullied"" her and ruined her table and grill. The table has normal wear and tear from pictures she sent and the grill was never cleaned by her either. I am wondering my chances in small claims. To me it's a simple her name is on a signed document and I can prove she repeatedly paid me every month for the past 1.5 years until this date. I have texts showing she was a bully to me in all actuality as well as agreed upon payments for each month. Would this be enough to get my money out of her? I am only seeking the $566 for her portion of rent since this is the only payment in writing between the 3 of us. I also have full support from the 3rd roommate and additional people that have witnessed this girls behavior. Just want to understand my chances before I waste time. I think she has money saved but its feeling the pain of buying her first home and decided she would just with hold money. Feel free to ask any additional questions!",1
"Wisconsin Safe Housing ACT/Lease Questions. A few months ago I moved out of my apartment building. The reasoning behind this was because I had fallen victim to harassment and stalking. My car tires were slashed outside of the building, and a picture was sent to me of my apartment door so they somehow gained access to the building, they also sent messages stating that they would cause physical harm. I field a police report with the local police department, who said they couldn't really do anything because there was no evidence, or whiteness to the events, and because they were using a fake phone number and fake accounts they couldn't track them. So I decided to leave. 

When I left, I contacted the onsite manager by phone, and had advised him of my situation. I said I was going to leave in accordance to Wisconsin Statute 704.16. This would allow me to break my lease early with no consequences. However, I made a deal with him, that I know I should have got in writing, but I agreed to pay rent until he found a new tenant. He promised me that he would find someone ASAP. I continued to pay, and pay, and pay. No tenants in 3 months. I have unfortunately run out of money and have a month an a half left on my old lease.

Today my old property manager texted me asking for rent money for this month. I don't have it. Am I obligated to give him the remainder of the money? I told him that I don't have the cash, and reminded him of all of this. But I have not received any word back. I understand that I should have just written a letter and provided the police report at the time, but since he had always been so nice I thought I would help him out by continuing to pay in the time being. If I sent him the letter and report now, would I still be able to get out of the lease?

Also is it required by law in Wisconsin for them to provide me with a copy of my lease? I know it is in some states, but I'm not sure about Wisconsin. I never received one, and had requested a copy multiple times during my stay at the property. If it is an obligation on their part, does it void the lease having not provided me with one, even after requesting it?",1
"[UK] Employee lied about reason for leaving at last employer, bad enough that we do not want to keep him on. What do?. Hi reddit,

Got an issue here with a (currently suspended) employee in my place of work, we have not yet hired a legal rep IRL as I would like to get some advice first before we decide to make the investment.

Issue is below:

Employee declared that they had resigned from their previous place of work when we interviewed them. Been employed for a year (passed probation) and due to a tip off (came from outside the business we believe, somebody from their previous place of work), we have now discovered that they were actually dismissed for fraud from the last employer (when they told us they resigned). 

Reference check was done before being offered the position (as per usual), but reason for leaving was not disclosed by the references (we always try and get the reason for leaving if possible). We have no signed documents from the employee confirming their reason for leaving; only written information is interview notes when we interviewed them, but obviously they would not have signed this (and new employees do not normally see their interview notes).

As stated, employee has passed probation so we cannot simply dismiss that easily. Currently suspended employee and waiting for a meeting date, but unsure if we have a case here… he's suspended with pay so I doubt he's worried, probably just got his feet up at home.

Management does not want this employee working for us any longer given what he was dismissed for in the last company and intentionally did not declare it in this one (and as we are an insurance-based company, something like fraud is obviously going to raise warning flags. As stated he is currently suspended (with pay) and is waiting for a meeting date with his manager and HR. He has no previous warnings or anything as such on his record, he mostly keeps to himself and doesn't socialise that much (which can go either way to be honest, if he is up to something with our company then it would make sense to keep to yourself).

Thanks to all that read / give advice!

"Uninhabitable Apartment - Please help!. Redditors, I'm am in desperate need of some help here. Let me try to make this as short as I can, but please bear with me. I recently flew out to Pennsylvania to check out an apartment that I was planning to lease for 9 months. I was not impressed, but I was in desperate need of a place to live, and, like an idiot, I signed the lease.

The lease started the first of this month, but I just arrived to take occupancy. I literally walked in to my landlord changing a lightbulb in one of the bedrooms and him telling me that the ceiling fan does not work; this is all fine and dandy since I am pretty easy-going, but it kind of threw me off that it was so last minute to be fixing things in the place and not have it ready to go when clearly knowing about pre-existing issues, not to mention that the lease officially started on the 1st (and today, or yesterday I guess, was the 11th).

Here's where it crosses the line for me. The place was clearly, I mean clearly, not cleaned prior to my arrival, which I thought was the landlord's responsibility. There are dead gnats and insects, spiders in cupboards, I took a video of a cockroach crawling across the floor, the toilet had black soot (who knows, really) on its seat, the oven was completely filthy (he himself ""admitted"" he did not clean the oven), etc. There was a strip of carpet placed over some linoleum in the kitchen, and when I removed it, there was a hole in the ground exposing the concrete underneath. There's exposed insulation in the closets, I can peel back the ""carpet"" in the bedroom to reveal cardboard which had just been left there to catch paint drip from painting the walls. The list goes on.

Please Reddit, help me to find a way out of this lease. I want to approach this with my landlord in a very non-confrontational manner and explain I made a mistake leasing and would like to move out early. Everything is on the table (ex. Forfeiting security deposit and terminating lease, etc.), but I don't want to pay a penny more than I have to for something which is, in my opinion, uninhabitable. I appreciate you all, thanks for your help and advice!",1
"[Los Angeles, CA] Precedent to sue attorney in Texas for morality clause violations?. Hi guys, sorry if this takes a while to read. I thank you for your patience.

To make a long story short: two months ago, someone messaged me asking for help with an investment fund. He said that he had spend 13 years working on an software trading program that accurately predicts the foreign exchange market. I realized that he was woefully unprepared to run or manage a fund and consulted him on how to set up a fund. He likely was not going to pay me but that's fine, I wanted him to succeed as accomplish his goals.
I later realized that it was very unlikely he had programmed an worthwhile arbitrage code, as he claimed to have, because he showed a lack of understanding for basic macroeconomic concepts. Furthermore, his trading policies involve SEC violations and using boiler room tactics for obtaining funding. Additionally, he nonchalantly expressed that he could choose however much to give back to investors, whenever--indicating a ponzi scheme like distribution. When I expressed my disagreements, he commanded me to get back in line and told me to get him ""operating capital"" for his fund. He had also mentioned knowing cartel members (with implied threat), and saying that he wanted to work with them, thus signaling a money laundering scheme.
I requested that he stop what he was doing and told him that I will not be providing him with operating capital. He then told me that he had recorded all of our conversations and will release all my information public (where I work, live, etc.). He will then call my workplace and pretend to be a client being harass by me, as well as actively seek out my clients and harass them. The gist of his intent is that it'd be easier for me to bribe him to stop, then to file all the legal proceedings to sue him.
Furthermore, he is seeking out attorneys to assist him in harassing me as well as file a lawsuit for having called what he was doing a ponzi scheme.

My question is this: Assuming that he finds a corrupt attorney willing to assist him, do I have the grounds to sue this attorney for morality clause violations?",0
"Got scammed when subleasing... Apartments won't help.... This is a long story, but I will try to make it short.
I bought a house in June, so I wanted to move out of my apartment. However, my lease contract did not have an early termination fee (I found out that Texas laws are terrible for renters).
So I decided to try subleasing my apartment, announcing it on craigslist. I was offering good incentives to whoever decided to move in, hoping to find someone as soon as possible.
Apparently, the only legal way to sublease the apartment was to remain in the contract and add the new renter as a roommate.
l felt safe since I knew that the apartments always do a background check before accepting someone.
Several people asked about the apartment, but the one that finally accepted my offer was a woman. Some things on her profile were weird, but in the end, she passed the background check and things looked ok.
On July, I got a call from the apartments. They told me that Ivy had rented the apartment to two other guys and that she did not live there anymore (I visited her before and I am sure she was living there in June). She was not answering her phone and she had not paid July's rent. At that point, I tried contacting her at her job and they told me that she never worked there.
I had to pay the rent, late fees, insurance, etc. The guys that were renting the apartment from her were asked to move out immediately and they also lost a lot of money (from rent and deposit).
The worst part is that the apartment complex is not giving me any information to help me locate her or even sue her and they won't take any action since I am paying the rent. They also say that I cannot search for another person to rent the apartment since I would need her signature! So my only option is to pay a reletting fee and the monthly rent until the apartment is rented.
Do you have any idea about how to proceed in this case? How can I get the apartments to help me? Are they partially responsible since they did the background check and approved her? I am planning to go to small court to sue her and see how that goes. But if you have more ideas I would really appreciate them.",1
"I'm almost certain my grandmother's maid stole $180 worth of my lipsticks from my vanity drawer, but my grandmother won't believe me. How do I get my belongings back?. I hate to make a post about this because I realize it seems somewhat insignificant but /r/makeupaddiction said I should post here instead.

I have a very large lipstick collection, but I keep it organized and make sure everything is in its place. I left for the weekend and my drawer had everything in it, but when I returned I noticed my lipsticks took up significantly less space than they used to, and then noticed a couple of my lipsticks were missing. Some that I'd never even taken out. Then I noticed another missing. Then I took out the drawer and sat down to evaluate-- NINE in total were missing. Some of them my very favorite ones. At 20 bucks each, this sets me back $180.

The only person that had been in this house other than my grandmother was her maid. The only obvious answer to this was that her maid stole my lipsticks. I can't come up with any other solution. Mind you, my grandmother loves her maid. So when I told her about this she refused to believe me-- she called me crazy and that I just lost them all and don't talk to her about this. I'm not even allowed to ask her maid about it.

I cannot afford to replace this stuff. I'm a student on basically minimum wage and I built up my collection over a long period of time. 20 dollars is a big deal to me. And now I have to drop 180 on stuff I already owned? Because someone felt that they could just have a party with my stuff and get away with it?

I need to get those lipsticks back. She's coming back tomorrow morning and I was thinking about confronting her in the driveway before she went in. Thing is, no one is going to admit to stealing. My grandmother would probably kick me out if I got her fired (even though she deserves it), so I was thinking about contacting her agency but I don't really know. How do I best confront her in a way that will maybe get my belongings back? I can't stand the thought of her getting away with this. I'm absolutely devastated.

Any advice would be really appreciated. :/ Thanks in advance.",0
"My parents are going through a divorce due to my mothers alcoholism. How can my fathers finances be protected from her?. *Location: England*

My parents are about to go through a divorce through no fault of my Father. My mothers alcoholism has gotten worse over the years and my dad can no longer take the emotional turmoil no more. She is stuck in a cycle and will not seek help or change her ways so my dad has to go. The turning point for me was my mother was diagnosed with esophagus cancer at 47 (very rare) due to her obsessive smoking and alcohol abuse. She was given a second chance after operating and was all clear but slowly slipped back to her old ways before getting much worse.

Divorce in the UK is a very financially toilsome outcome for the male party and I want to know how my dad can keep what he has worked hard for without my mam prying everything away? He is essentially the victim of years of emotional abuse and it is completely my mothers failings that have forced him into divorce so why should he have to pay for her failings.

Information that may be of use when giving advice:

- Three kids together. One 16, one 22 (me) and another 23. Only myself and my younger brother live at the family home.
- My dad worked away a lot for the first 18 years or so of my life whereas my mam was a housewife. 
-My mother got a job a few years ago as my dad needed help with the bills but then was diagnosed with cancer one year ago and has been on the sick since
- She is able bodied and in my eyes should be in work
- The house is up for sale and my father is in contact with the solicitors to go through divorce proceedings. I'm pretty sure both names are on the mortgage.

I would love my father to be able to part ways with this woman and get on with his life instead of paying my mother a 'lifestyle allowance'.  He has worked incredibly hard his entire life and shouldn't be forced into giving some alcoholic more money to spend on alcohol. I am not naive to the fact that my mother is obviously entitled to something but she certainly shouldn't be entitled to everything with this being her fault.

Please give me a solution to put a smile back on my Dad's face!",0
"Step-parent adoption/KY. I'm a mother of a super awesome three year old girl. I married my husband one year ago. 

My daughter's biological father was abusive and an alcoholic throughout our entire relationship.  I have been her sole caregiver since birth, but for nearly a year I did allow supervised visitation 2 days a week.  During that time, he lived with his mother, and by her own admission, she provided care(meals, baths, etc) during his visitation. 

 He has never held a job longer than 6 months.  Recently, he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine and other various drug related charges.  He is currently in drug court, is unemployed, and seems to be completely spiraling out.

Prior to his meth spiral, all visitation was facilitated through his sister, who is a social worker. I went no contact with him because his verbal abuse persists regardless of our relationship status.  Three months ago, his sister refused to facilitate any type of visitation with our daughter because he insisted we allow him to take her to his girlfriend's house overnight.  His girlfriend is a meth addict, covered in fresh track marks who lost her own children because of drug addiction and neglect.

Even if her bio dad DID beat his addiction issues (he won't, but hypothetically) he will still be inconsistent, verbally abusive and dangerous to my bubbly baby girl if he ever has access to her alone. 

I was lucky to marry a man nothing like her bio father. He is absolutely the best thing that has ever happened to us.

"Dad opened supplementary credit card with my Moms name, used the card himself. Now my Mom is being threated with legal action.. I'm writing this on behalf of my mom.
We live In Ontario, Canada.

A few years ago my dad created a supplementary credit card under my moms name. He kept both cards and my mom never used the card. Than, a few years bag my parents separated and my dad took the card with him.

Only a while back we received a notice from the bank the card was created under, apparently my dad has been using this card, but it's registered to my mom, so we received a letter requesting that we pay back the debt. My mom called the bank and told them she has nothing to do with the card, she requested her name be removed from the card. The bank says that they cannot remove the name before the full amount is paid back. We talked it out with my dad, and he told me it was settled, the problem would be fixed.

It seems that was not the case.
On July 13th, 2017, we received a letter from a legal firm. Apparently the bank has taken legal action on my mom, an they are requesting that she pay back the full amount spent. The problem is, my mom never used the card, that is not money she spent.

The letter was sent on June 29th, 2017, it stated that we must pay back a balance of $3,945.98 CAD. The amount is to gain interest annually at a rate of 19.8%. It also stated that if arrangements are not made within 10 days of the letter being sent, than legal action will be taken. It has been 14 days, we just received this letter.

I checked out the reviews for the Law Firm, it's technically a debt collector, and apparently their service is horrible. They are known to refuse to pick up calls so that interest is gained overtime, they seem to be all about money.

So now we have a problem. My Mom owes a bank money that she never used, it's quite possible that legal action will be taken by a potentially scummy company, and I doubt my dad will do anything to help.

So I've turned to my friend Reddit, I need your help, what can me and my mom do in this situation? How do we proceed?

Thank you for taking the time to read through this, I know it's quite long, but it means a lot to me.",0
"Military issue. Seeking legal advice, not sure where to start. Long read.. I'm not sure this is the right sub, but someone told me I need a civil attorney, and the ones I've called about my issue have told me they don't handle this kind of thing. Not sure where to go.

So, in January I went on terminal/ transition leave (a period of vacation time accrued during your enlistment and used at the end of your contract to help your transition from active duty to civilian life). During this time you are still technically in the military and therefore covered by Tricare (the military's health insurance). I planned to start my new civilian job during my leave specifically so my health insurance would overlap and I wouldn't be left without.

I had just moved to my new location and was unexpectedly rushed to the ER, because of inadequate care previously provided to me at the military hospital I was stationed at. An improperly placed IUD that caused massive amounts of bleeding and needed to be removed. My primary military hospital denied the claim to Tricare (even though they were the ones who fucked up), leaving me with a $3,000 medical bill. I tried calling my primary care provider multiple times to get this fixed, I tried looking for a Tricare representative at the hospital and was told there wasn't one. I was even lied to at one point, told the necessary paperwork was sent in- only to follow up with Tricare for them to tell me they hadn't received a damn thing.

Conveniently everyone's voicemail box is full or they're not answering. Been given the runaround over and over again. Emails and promises gone unanswered, calls not returned, and no one of any use that I have talked to. I have been trying for five months in between my 10 hour work days and with the difficulty of a 3 hour time difference. I finally had to pay the damn bill, so now I'm in debt.

This is a breach of contract. I signed with the knowledge that I would have health insurance until I got out of the military. I feel like I've been taken advantage of; since I was so close to getting out, they probably figured there wasn't anything I could do about it. If you have ANY advice, I would greatly appreciate it.",0
"Sublease apartment and got scammed.. what to do next?. This is a long story, but I will try to make it short.

I bought a house in June, so I wanted to move out of my apartment. However, my lease contract did not have an early termination fee (I found out that Texas laws are terrible for renters).

So I decided to try subleasing my apartment, announcing it on craigslist. I was offering good incentives to whoever decided to move in, hoping to find someone as soon as possible.

Apparently, the only legal way to sublease the apartment was to remain in the contract and add the new renter as a roommate.

l felt safe since I knew that the apartments always do a background check before accepting someone.

Several people asked about the apartment, but the one that finally accepted my offer was a woman named Ivy Lee Cruz. Some things on her profile were weird, but in the end, she passed the background check and things looked ok.

On July, I got a call from the apartments. They told me that Ivy had rented the apartment to two other guys and that she did not live there anymore
(I visited her before and I am sure she was living there in June). She was not answering her phone and she had not paid July's rent. At that point, I tried contacting her at her job and they told me that she never worked there.

I had to pay for the rent, late fees, insurance, etc.
The guys that were renting the apartment from her were asked to move out immediately and they also lost a lot of money (from rent and deposit).

The worst part is that the apartment complex is not giving me any information to help me locate her or even sue her and they won't take any action since I am paying the rent. They also say that I cannot search for another person to rent the apartment since I would need her signature! So my only option is to pay a reletting fee and the monthly rent until the apartment is rented.

Do you have any idea about how to proceed in this case? How can I get the apartments to help me?
Are they partially responsible since they did the background check and approved her? 
I am planning to go to small court to sue her and see how that goes. But if you have more ideas I would really appreciate them.",1
"[MI] My girlfriend was driving my car in Chicago, backed into a sketchy guy.. So I'm from Michigan, insurance is in Michigan also.  Girlfriend was driving my car in Chicago, where she love-tapped someone's front bumper while backing out of a spot.  There was no damage to my car.  He claims his bumper was cracked and basically needs to be replaced.  The post-accident scene was handled badly by both sides.  He took 1 picture of the damage to my car (was actually a pre-existing scratch, but my girlfriend didnt know that), a picture of my licence plate, and a picture of her licence, and they also exchanged phone numbers.  His bumper had very obvious previous damage on it outside of what may have just happened.  Sketchy part No.1: No insurance information was exchanged whatsoever.  Police were not called.  My girlfriend (20) is a nervous wreck while this is all happening, she had never even bumped a car before.  He never said anything about exchanging insurance information.  He was a 30ish year old man driving a car worth at least 10x of what mine is.  I begin to suspect this man doesn't have insurance.  A week or more passes, suspicions seem to be confirmed when...  Sketchy part No.2: He texts said girlfriend about shopping around for a body shop to get estimates for his bumper.  After talking to me, we agree that we should tell him to call his insurance company and send a picture of his damage.  This seems the right thing to do because insurance companies usually know how to handle these things.  He never sends picture.  Again suspicions that he has no insurance and there was no damage caused anyway.  Three weeks pass, suspicions seem to be confirmed again (until today...) Sketchy part No.3: Another text is received, saying that 1. He already sent her a picture of the damage (he didn't), and 2. I should call my insurance company since he was not at fault.

Was I right to be suspicious about his activity, namely not exchanging insurance information, the length of time between communications, the already present damage on his bumper, and his apparent non-willingness to talk to his insurance company?

"We cannot work with co-founder anymore. If we continue working on the project separately, what will happen? (or how can we do it as pleasantly as possible). A month ago we began working with a guy who had an idea that we liked a lot. He's young, fresh out of a 1-year entrepreneurship program that he did right after college. He's charismatic, and at first we liked him. 

I say ""we,"" it's myself and my friend who are both (skilled) programmers. 

The idea is not unique: other people are working on it, there are a couple companies starting to do it exactly in the space we've been trying to enter. However, it's a very new area so it's exciting and fun to work on. 

Over the last few weeks, we've been developing a lot of code and we incorporated the company quickly because our co-founder needs a visa soon. 

A couple days ago we decided we can't work with him anymore: he is too immature and wants to be the one on top, the one with the most shares and the CEO title. He obviously feels like it's more HIS projects that ours. He doesn't compromise well, we've had arguments and it seems every time we end up saying ""alright, we'll do it your way which is not *completely* unreasonable, we want to keep the peace and make things work."" Anyway, it's making it hard to work with him. I don't trust him. And also, I don't respect him because of the aforementioned qualities coupled with the fact that he actually doesn't really contribute anything to the business. He's not particularly skilled at talking to people or writing or having good ideas or design. 

Anyway, we don't want to work with him anymore. We still like the idea and are excited about the work we've done on it so far, and have a key connection that he doesn't have that will help us a lot towards success. 

We're thinking of just taking the code we wrote and nothing else except the basic idea (which, as I said, is not particularly novel) and doing our own business. 

We're also considering potentially going to work for the primary competitor who are looking for a CTO and seem very qualified on the business and marketing side (but we're not at all sure about this option either). 

Would love some advice! Thank you in advance.",0
"[NY] Being sued based on alleged oral contract for rent return.. New York here.

 I sublet my apartment to someone for one month, and he signed an addendum on my original lease contract but there'sis no mention of the duration or price for him.

Two weeks into the lease, he tells me he wants to move out early and asked me if he could have the remaining rent back. It's a pretty small amount (Under $300), but still I see no reason why I should refund part of someone's rent just because they changed their mind halfway through the lease.

Anyways, he moved out and I returned his deposit promptly, but decided not to refund his remaining month of rent. According to him, I verbally agreed to refund his rent and now owe him the amount for the time he didn't stay. He says that he will sue me, and has sent me pictures of the small claims file (unfilled). He has repeatedly sent me venmo requests for the rent, telling me I owe him money, and that I agreed to refund his remainder.

Since I have not budged, he has steadily been decreasing the amount of money he is requesting but continues to persist. 


There is no written agreement that I will refund him his remaining rent after he moves out. According to him, his girlfriend will back him up on me verbally agreeing to him that I'll refund it after he moves out.

My question is:

If he files to the small claims court, what will be the next steps? I'll have to show up no matter what. I am out of state for the summer and travelling back to NY will be a medium inconvenience, to the point that I'd rather send him the money than to travel back and miss work.

EVEN IF I did verbally agree to refund him his rent, but I didn't sign anything, is that legally binding?

I find this case absolutely ridiculous. Regardless, it'll be him and his girlfriend claiming that I agreed to refund his rent when he moved out early. There is absolutely no incentive for me to do so, since I'd be practically giving him money for service/contract already agreed upon.

Does he have a case here at all? What should be the next steps? I'm not going to get a lawyer for something this small, and I believe that they're not recommended in small claims either.

Thanks in advance.",1
"[Minnesota] Guy ran a red light and totalled my car, and his insurance has just denied my claim.. I was on my way home from picking my girlfriend up from work about 3 weeks ago. It was just after 11 pm and I had a friend accompany me since we were hanging out anyways and we wanted to grab a bite to eat after. I pull up to a red left turn arrow and waited for it to turn green, the light proceeds to turn green (green, not flashing yellow, to be clear) so I accelerate to get onto the ramp that heads onto the freeway, halfway across the intersection I see headlights to my right side and half a second later an F350 with a pushbar is shearing through the front end of my car and I'm screaming what the fuck. The airbags did not deploy for whatever reason. I go into emergency mode and tell my passengers to get out of the car, and get to safety since my car was smoking and I didn't know if it would start on fire or not. The other driver (who's truck was totally fine) walked over and admitted fault, I proceeded to bitch at him for being a reckless fucking idiot who could have killed all 3 of us while also contacting police. So the cop shows up, takes mine and my passenger's statements, and goes to talk to the guy who had just gotten off the phone with his boss since it was a work truck. This was my first accident so I was totally caught off guard and didn't have much of an idea of what to do. I took pictures of my car and the intersection, and also took a picture of his license plate and insurance information. The past 3 weeks have been a jumble of phone calls and trying to figure out what the hell to do to get what's owed to me. Fast forward yesterday, I finally get a hold of their insurance agent amd she tells me she will send out an adjuster to estimate the damages and whatever else they do so here I am waiting until I get another call from their agent today. Apparently they are denying my claim due to insufficient evidence that it was their drivers fault. I've never been involved in anything like this and I have no idea where to start besides getting a hold of the police report. So I guess my question would be what the hell do I do now?

"[OK] What type of law firm covers this?. I am in the process of gathering information to find an attorney to bring this up with, and I can't figure out what type of firm this fall under.

I am located in Oklahoma, the company I have an issue with is located in Pittsburg, PA, and has servers located in Costa Rica.  The developer in question I believe is also located in the new england area.

The issue involves an online game that has a MLM type incentive structure, you get returns based on the people under you. It also has a vibrant economy that has real world implications as to results of some games/minigames which are promised to be ""fair"" and ""random"". 

Issue 1: The lead developer changed the incentive structure and cut the earnings from downstream in half.  He justified this as saying it prevents people trying to steal downstreams by profit sharing, as now he ""automatically"" gives the profit sharing back to the downstream. Even though some people did not profit share and so realized a very real 50% or more cut in income.

Issue 2: Over the past few years the developer has made many statements of things he would ""never do/wont happen"" that were then used to make economic choices, but then he does them a few months/a year later to the economic detriment of those who took actions based on his statements. Given that the lead developer and employees have not changed in this time period, it's felt he's still liable for the contradiction.

Issue 3: The lead developer has made several statements about the fairness/programming of some of the minigames in this game, that are either provably false, or probabilisticaly unlikely to be true, that has similar economic damage. While randomness is hard to prove/disprove, deviations can be shown on results in-game vs an out of game programmed simulation with the same ""rules"".

So my questions are:
 
1. What type of firm should i be looking for?  Civil litigation? Fraud?  

2. What jurisdiction am I looking at/will i need to get a national/out of state firm or is it not an entire waste of time to check in-state consultations first?

Sorry if this just seems so basic, I just don't want to be wasting peoples time barking up the wrong tree. Thank you for the help!",0
"Is it legal for my landlord to let the Comcast guy in my bedroom while I'm at work, with no notice? [Utah]. My boyfriend came home from work today to find a Comcast service guy hanging out in our bedroom. Or rather, the guy SAID he was from Comcast, but he wasn't wearing a uniform or anything to identify him with Comcast, and his truck was unmarked. He didn't have an ID badge or anything. My boyfriend freaked out and told the guy to get out. 

Our property manager left a note on our door on July 6 saying that Comcast services would be coming by on July 7. We were concerned about a tech being in our apartment unsupervised while we were both at work, so the manager said she would have the maintenance guy oversee the service call. We were still apprehensive, but we know the maintenance manager and trust him, so we thought it would be fine. 

July 7 came and went. We came home from work and hadn't seen any Comcast person. We didn't know if anyone had come or not. Our management, as you can see, is terrible about communication. 

Note: we did not request Comcast to come out. We already have our internet service all set up with Comcast--this is our complex's service setup. 

Our lease does say that management has access to our apartment for maintenance and such, but I was under the impression that the law in Utah says that they must give us 24 hours' notice. Notice was given that they would be coming three days ago, but the visit today was completely unexpected and unwelcome. 

Also, he broke a shelf on our bookshelf when he moved it to do his work, tracked mud onto our brand new rug, had his grimy work gear all over our bed, and left sawdust all over the place.

So one, the tech was here 3 days after they said he would be. Two, he was unsupervised. Three, he wrecked our stuff. This feels like a huge violation. 

Our downstairs neighbors were not home when the tech came to their unit, but they said he left a huge mess, left the lights on, their furniture was moved around, and again, sawdust everywhere. 

Do we have any recourse? The manager has been unresponsive so far. We do have renters insurance. Our main concern is this violation of them letting just anyone barge into our place with no/inadequate notice.",1
"Can I dispute ambulance bill from shady ambulance business?. I was coming home from a local bar about a mile from my house at around midnight, I got to my place but realized I had forgot my key and the door was locked. I decided to climb up to the roof of my house and in order to go down a ladder that was on the back side of my house, because the sliding door on the back porch is always unlocked. This was in San Francisco, where all the houses are connected to each other basically, which is why I had to climb over the house instead of just going around to the back.
Someone apparently thought I was a burglar and called the police. A bunch of cop cars show up while I'm on top of the roof, so I decide to climb back down and talk to them. As soon as I got down from the roof I was tackled to the sidewalk by one of the cops and held down and cuffed. Being tackled onto the sidewalk scraped my forehead and it was bleeding a little.(tiny amount, not dripping blood, more like a scrape than a cut) They called an ambulance because of this.
After explaining everything to the police and showing proof that it was indeed my address, they uncuffed me and apologized and told me to remember my keys next time.
By this point the ambulance had arrived, and the EMTs insisted that I needed to be taken to the hospital. I told them I was perfectly fine and had a small scrape on my head that could be taken care of with some neosporin and a bandaid. I insisted that I was fine and that all I wanted to do was go into my house that was 20 feet away and that I was refusing an ambulance ride to the hospital. They told me they were legally required to take me and I was basically physically strapped to a gurney and put in the ambulance. The hospital was less than 5 minutes away, and as soon as I saw a doctor they told me I was perfectly fine and could go home, and didn't even charge me anything.
I ended up getting a $3000 ambulance bill. The ambulance company is privately owned, and googling it shows tons of people with similar stories about being forced into taking ambulance rides against their will and then charged ridiculous amounts.
Is there anything I can do to dispute this bill? How can I be forced into an ambulance for a minor scratch?",0
"[CO] Management falsely editing employees time punches to reflect ""compony policy"". Hello all,

I am in a predicament right now regarding my current employer. I recently became a member of the management team at a new local restaurant. My company currently has six restaurants under its belt, and we opened this new restaurant for business last year and I've worked there since. My co-supervisor was recently trained on how to complete payroll before payday rolled around. In passing she candidly said:
&gt;I have so much work to do! I have to go through everyone's time punches and edit them to be at least 5 minutes before their shift.

Our company policy essentially states that all employee's punches that are earlier than 5 minutes before a scheduled shift time will be edited to be, at most, 5 minutes before that shift. 

That night I talked to one of our company's longer tenured managers and asked him about this practice. He told me that its ""company policy"" and everyone agreed to these policies when they signed their contracts. Many of the managers at other restaurants seem complacent about this practice. I know that you can't just write whatever you want in a contract and call it a day so I was thinking this may be an unenforceable.

I did some light research on the topic on the DOL's website and, from my understanding of the law, the law states that an employer may only edit time punches if an employee incorrectly recorded time (i.e forgetting to clock in or out). But they may not edit time punches in order to reflect something like a ""company policy.""

Now I'm not losing any sleep from my punch being edited from 2:54pm to 2:55pm. I am, however, concerned that my company is simply operating unethically. I want to talk to my HR representative and understand more about where this policy is coming from. But I also feel a little slimy doing payroll and having to edit these punches. Long term I am not interested in going to court about lose wages, etc. I just want my company to operate ethically and fairly.

So, my questions:
1) Is this legal at all?
2) Is this employment contract ""unenforceable"" because of this verbiage?
3) Is there anything a lowly supervisor can do about this company-wide practice?

Thanks in advance",0
"Neighbors dog broke the fence and killed my dog. WA. So this morning I woke up and let my 2 dogs out to go potty. They are both very small dogs, a chihuahua and a yorkie. I went back upstairs to get ready for work when I heard what I thought to be my two dogs fighting with each other.


So I came downstairs again, holding my 8 month old this time  and checked my back yard. This is when I saw the neighbors dog had my chihuahua in its mouth by the belly and was flinging her around. 


I yelled for my husband to come down , he opened the door and the dog ran into their property through the hole he had made in the fence. 


I didn't initially open the door since I didn't want him to charge at me while I was holding my daughter.  My husband then told me to call the police while he tended to our dog who could barely even move. 

When the police officer arrived he was really mad. He said he has had calls about these neighbors multiple times for their dog. It is illegal to own a Pitbull in our county. And he said they cited them multiple times for it. He took our statements and went to speak with them. He took their dog in his patrol car.


The officers gook pictures of the fence, my dog and theirs. I did as well. 


We took my dog to the vet and she passed away a few hours later.  I called the officer to let him know so that he may add it to his report.


I am not sure what our next step should be. I am worried about retaliation from them since they have caused problems before. 


We have our suspicions about the death of our other chihuahua, and we think they might have fed her marijuana. The vet said she had died of marijuana poisoning (?). No one in our house smokes, but we know that they do since they do it in their front porch often.  

It is too late to do anything about that but I feel they will try to hurt our other dog since this happened. We plan on getting cameras to monitor the back yard. 


The officer suggested I take them to court over the vet bills (this was before our dog died). I don't know how any of that works. 

We just bought our house a year ago so moving is not an option. They are renting, so I don't know if this is grounds for eviction from the landlord. 


Please tell me what my next step should be.",0

He(she at the time) broke this agreement and had an affair with someone of the opposite sex and when confronted about it, they blamed her(him at the time) for it. Apparently ever since he's made her the scapegoat for all their personal and relationship problems. This has had a considerable tole on her, becoming extremely depressed and attempting suicide by over overdose at least once.

"Got pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt in the state of Arizona. Hello,

I was recently stopped in the state of Arizona for not wearing my seatbelt. To be exact, I was on the Salt River Pima reservation. As I was leaving pulling out of the parking lot of my community college (which is on the reservation) I was pulled over. I have read through the Arizona state legislature rules on seatbelt laws and it clearly states that Arizona is a ""secondary state"". My understanding is that you cannot be pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt if that is the primary reason for the stop. 

Reference: 
""There are two main types of safety belt laws: primary
enforcement and secondary enforcement. Primary enforcement
laws allow police officers to stop a vehicle because of a suspected
seat belt violation, while secondary enforcement laws allow peace
officers to issue a citation for a seat belt violation during a traffic
stop for another violation. 

Arizona is a secondary enforcement state, except for children
under the age of eight who meet a certain height requirement.
Arizona requires the use of safety belts where they are installed, by
front seat occupants of a motor vehicle. The driver of the vehicle
is responsible for the use of safety belts by all passengers under the
age of 16, whereas front seat passengers at least 16 years of age
may be cited for a safety belt violation. The maximum civil penalty
for a person violating this law is $10 for each violation. ""

From the Arizona state legislature.

The citation that I received was 28-909A1 which states that a seatbelt must be worn while the vehicle is in motion.

The police officer was a reservation officer and he made it very clear that my lack of wearing a seatbelt was the primary reason for the stop and for citation.

I have court tomorrow and was wondering if I could reason with the judge on this. Does anyone have any advice or have a better understanding on these laws. If the state legislature states that it is a secondary law, it seems as if I should not have been pulled over solely for not wearing my seatbelt. 

I do understand the importance of seatbelts and why they keep us safe. However, I did make a mistake and would greatly appreciate some advice on how to deal with this. 

Thanks",0
"Need help understanding probate process for small estate. Hello, looking for some advice about the probate process for a small estate in the state of Arkansas. I've read up on what to do but I am still confused. Trying to understand if I need to go through probate court, or if this can just be solved through Arkansas's small estate process. I feel like this should be straightforward, so hopefully someone has some answers or recommendations. 

My mother passed away last month. My father passed away 11 years ago, and I only have one (younger) brother.

I am named in her will as the executor of the will. My brother and I are listed in the will as beneficiaries, splitting any assets 50/50. 

Her assets that are part of the estate are as follows:
Checking account &amp; savings account, together totalling about $3K
11 year old van which she didn't owe money on, worth $1K at most

Assets that have my brother and I named as beneficiaries (so they shouldn't count towards in the probate process, right?):
Life insurance policy for about $40K
IRA account, about $30K
401K account, about $7K
Another savings account, has about $200

Debts:
Student loans, at least $20K
Chase credit card, about $2K
Not aware of others but will be running a credit report soon to confirm

From what I've read, her estate qualifies as a small estate in Arkansas, since it's worth less than $100K. So it should bypass probate court, and I simply need to file an affidavit of small estate. However, on the form for the affidavit of small estate, one of the stipulations for filing as a small estate is ""There are no unpaid claims or demands against the decedent or the decedent's estate."" This is where I am confused. Chase wants to make a claim against the estate. If they make a claim, her assets are enough to cover the amount of their claim...so I assume I would need to pay them from the estate. However, I can't get the funds from her bank account to pay the claim without filing this affidavit. So how the heck am I supposed to pay them? Do I have to go through the probate court simply because there is a claim against her estate? I don't believe I should pay it out of my own pocket, it's not my debt. So it should come out of the estate. I'm just so confused about what to do next.",0

It is my first time renting and after 18 months (last 6 in a month-to-month) I got a 90-day end of tenancy notice saying that the house is for sale. 

Now, I was not sure what I was doing and this followed: 

1) Unaware of the 30-day notice to vacate I had to sent I immediately started looking for new apartments and was accepted on a new one today (07/11) with move-in date on August 1st. 

2) and I called the property management to notify I had found a new place and that I would be able to move on August 1st. The agent said it was OK through over the phone. 

After reading about it better I found I had to send a 30-day notice, which was not compatible with move out date of 08/01. 

3) I give the agent a call and tell him I have to send a 30-day notice but in order for it to be valid for 08/01 my date would have to be 07/01. He says it's OK and even tell me that simply stating via email that I was able to move 08/01 was enough. I disagree and say I'll send you a 30-day noticed like that anyway. 

4) I send him a 30-day today notice to the same email he was talking to me, backdated 07/01 and ask for him to acknowledge it and confirm that he was in agreement with my moving date. He does neither of that and ignores the e-mail. 

In other e-mails he is always really vague and avoid direct answers to my August 1st move-out date. He refuses to specify a prorated rent in the case I move in that date.


Now to the problem: 

That 30-day notice says I recognize that failure to vacate on the date set forth may cause owner/agent to suffer actual damages.

Question: 

1) Does he have to acknowledge the 30-day notice on his e-mail and answer my question in order for the notice to be valid? 

2) What happens if I do it the usual way and send first class mail with another one dated 07/12 with a later move out date? Will he be able to say I already had sent one and did not vacate, therefore causing damages? 

3) What is the best way to fix this mess, invalidate the unanswered, previous 30-day notice and have a valid move out date so that I don't end up paying an extra rent? 

Let me know if some part of it is too convoluted so I can explain it better.

Thanks all!",1
"[WV] Steps to take when a dealership can't repair your vehicle?. I bought a 2014 Ford fusion used about 6 months ago. A few days after having it I found out it has some issue where it goes into the limp home mode if you accelerate too quickly. This means power train service light and airbag light come on and the car refuses to accelerate normally until turned off and back on again. It's sometimes accompanied by a check engine light but not always. I bought it with a third party extended service warranty that covers almost everything and it still has the manufacturers power train warranty. 

It was bought used at a non Ford dealership who initially tried to repair it under their warranty for me, but they were unable to diagnose it and they had me take it to a Ford dealership and they would pay for it. 

Over the course of about 4 months and 5 visits, they replaced a mass airflow sensor, the battery, and the throttle body. None of that fixed the issue. 

I took it to a different Ford dealership but they were unable to fix it under warranty (the third party warranty required it be fixed at the selling dealer if I was within 40 miles of it) and they wouldn't honor the power train warranty. I took it back to the welling dealer who said they couldn't diagnose it and they told me to go to Ford. I took it back to the Ford they sent me to previously and they said it would take them several days to diagnose it and asked me to come back later. 

At this point I was in the process of moving across the state, so I moved and found a Ford dealer near me and took it there. They kept it for a week and replaced the accelerator pedal. The check engine light came back on with the same code so I took it back the next day. They turned the code off and test drove it for a while and it didn't come back so they stated it was fixed. 

I picked it up again and the original limp home mode issue happened again so in immediate dropped it off again. That was yesterday, and at this point its been at the third ford garage for 2 weeks now. I've been to garages for the same issue about 7 times or so over the last 6 months. 

At this point it seems unlikely to me it'll get fixed and this has been an extreme hassle dealing with. Do lemon laws apply to used cars? What are my options here?",0
"Recruiters trying to invoice for $9000 placement fee for declining job I never started or officially accepted. My OP here: https://np.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6mtunq/recruiter_pressuring_me_and_sending_red_flags/

(Tenn.) I have no official offer letter, start date, salary, nor do I have that I accepted the job anywhere in writing. I have an email from the recruiter saying she accepted the job for me, but I never responded to it. After I sent an email explaining why I wanted to renege and cancel my contract with the recruitment firm (per my reasons in the original post) and take myself out of the running for the job the recruiter sent me an email stating: ""You signed a waiver that stated that if you accept the offer and don’t show up for the first day of work , accept a counter offer or don’t stay for a minimum of 90 days in that position– that you are financially responsible for the repayment of the placement fee ($9000). I have all the documentation that supports your acceptance and where you state you would tender your resignation and would like to start on the 7th of August""

I said I would LIKE to start on that date, but again, never said I accepted in writing nor was I given a start date or official offer. I spoke to the company who would be hiring me and they are baffled by all of this from the recruiters. 

I have a copy of my contract saying: 1. If the Candidate fails to report to work on her/his first day of employment with said employer for no reason or any reason other than major substantiated intervening acts beyond the control of the Candidate (e.g. severe weather, hospitalization, etc.), the Candidate agrees to pay The [recruiters] a fee for the placement services rendered of 25% of the starting salary offered by said employer and accepted by the Candidate.
2. If the Candidate voluntarily terminates said employment for any reason or is terminated for cause by said employer within the first ninety (90) business days of employment, the Candidate agrees to pay [recruiters] a fee for [recruiters] placement services rendered of 25% of the starting salary offered by said employer and accepted by the Candidate.


Does this have any ground to stand on?? Can they actually force me to take the job or pay them that fee with nothing in writing?",0
"Issues with Concierge (Quebec, Canada). Hey just looking for advice about how to reason with my buildings concierge. I've contacted former landlords to get their opinion but I'd like to hear as many as possible. First off, the proprietors of the building are pretty much unreachable. It's owned by the legal group representing a family that lives in Toronto. The address associated with the proprietor is an apartment in the building and no phone or email is listed.

Now for the issues;
-though not illegal the concierge makes me feel very uncomfortable by calling me petnames, doing bisous or touching my shoulders and arms whenever talking to me-all things I feel are inappropriate for a relationship that is purely professional. 
-he usually smokes in his apartment or outside the building but on a few occasions I have found him smoking in the hallways as he goes around the building which he is not allowed to do since the hallways are common areas
-he refuses the tenants to have guests, he yelled at my roommate as she and her boyfriend we taking his suitcase up to our apartment where he was invited to stay for the week between the end of his lease and his flight back home. He also yelled at me and my friend and blocked the front door in order to keep my friend from staying the weekend in my apartment saying I didn't have the right to have more than 3 people sleeping in the apartment at any time and if I wanted to have a guest stay the night I needed to file an application with him. 

I asked him if we could go over the lease so he could explain to me what part of it provided him the authority to require applications and refuse invited guests of tenants since I know that he has neither of those authorities. It's not listed in the basic lease we all sign and he didn't add it to the section where he listed any other rules regarding the apartment-he even made the error of saying the apartment may have 4 people in it though it's a 5 1/2 and signed by three people.

I'm worried filing a complaint with the régie will take too long especially since I've invited my brother to stay with me for a couple of days at the end of the month. What can I do that will keep him from acting inappropriately towards myself and the other tenants like this and making up rules not listed on the contracts?",1
"Found a misplaced stale dated paycheck in my papers, and called my employer to sort out my pay. They haven't given a reliable indication that they intend to pay me, and have started ignoring my follow-ups. What can I do?. location: Michigan

When I first called, they asked some general questions and said they'd get back to me in a few days. 
After a week I called them and they said the money probably went to the state as unclaimed money, so it would take them a little longer to get this sorted out, and [payroll person] would get back to me in a week. I received the paycheck slightly under two years ago, and looking at Michigan's laws, it looks to me like my pay would've gone to the state after a year, so that makes sense. 
A little more than a week later, I tried following up, and my phone call went straight to voicemail. I tried a few more calls at different times of day, and since they all went to voicemail, I suspect they blocked me. 
Around two weeks later, I went in-person to my old workplace with the check, explained my situation, and the person at the front office emailed [payroll person] on my behalf. I got an email back the same day sounding like they just heard about this for the first time. I emailed them back the next day, only to get an automated message saying that as of the previous day, they weren't working there anymore and I should send my queries to [generic payroll email] which promised a response in 48 hours. 
It's been over 3 work days since. 

In summary, it's been over a month since I brought this to their attention, and I don't know what has been happening on their end, nor do I know if they plan to pay me. 

I would go to the state and get the paycheck myself, but the michigan website for unclaimed money/property does not yield any results for my unclaimed paycheck - I don't know if that's a paperwork issue or what. I have my stale paycheck in hand, and I checked my bank account and it doesn't look like they ever paid me via direct deposit, so I don't think I'm mistaken. 

The check is worth about $1,000. I'm reluctant to take legal action, and I'm not sure it would be worth the time and money anyways... So what else can I do? Keep attempting to follow up? I'm tired and upset with doing that, but I don't know what else to do.

Thanks so much for the input",0
"Sprint lost a leased phone I returned. Have receipt from corporate store. They are trying to charge me for the phone.. Basically as title says. Got my son a contract with sprint, hes 16 so I pay for everything, got him a brand new LG V20 with a lease style contract under the condition that he worked for his uncle on the weekends. 

Well 16 year olds will be 16 year olds and he skipped out on more than 7 days worth of work. So punishment was I returned the phone to sprint and got him a basic flip phone with no data. 

I returned the phone to a corporate sprint store and paid a 35 restocking fee. I have a digital receipt from the store that shows the model and serial number of the phone returned. 

Somehow sprint lost the phone between the time I was given a receipt and now. 

They sent me a bill for 423.72. 

100 of that is my monthly payment and the other part is the cost of the phone I returned. 

I called last month when this happened and filed a dispute. Heard nothing back from them. 

This month I receive a pay or disconnect notice for the outstanding balance of 320 for the price of the phone. So I called very mad  but kept my cool. Talked with a supervisor and she seemed very helpful until the end. She said she would start another claim and it would be a week for the resolution. 

I asked her what happened with the first dispute and she said there was no resolution. I asked her what that means and she said she was unsure. She said she would place a hold on my account for the 320 to make sure it does not disconnect my service, but that hold would expire at the end of the claim. 

Well that happened today. I called again and made sure to speak to the same lady. I even waited on hold for 45 minutes to make this happen. She tells me that the claim was denied. No reason for the claim being denied was given.

I asked her if she had the receipt. She said no. I sent her my digital copy of the receipt. She agreed that his was an official receipt and was able to verify it in the system. But that I still owe for the phone. 

She has a receipt that she agrees is legit showing I returned the phone. So I did my part here. How can she claim I owe her money for a phone I followed procedure with? IS there any legal ground for her to say I owe for an expensive phone they lost?

Texas if that matters.",0
"Pep Boys put my son in danger and held me in their Fishers, IN location for 5 hours.. Yesterday morning,  I took my vehicle into Pep Boys on 96th street in Fishers, IN for work on the back brakes and an oil change. He was suppose to get out of school at 11:20 that should have not been an issue seeing that my appointment was for 9:00 am. At 10:58 they informed me that the supplier had delivered the wrong parts and they had to wait for new ones. I explained that I had to get back to Noblesville to pick up my son as my husband was 3 hours away, from school and was told ""Sorry, but the car is already tore apart there is nothing we can do but wait"". My son decided to walk home from the high school which is about 4-6 miles away. 20 minutes into his walk we were hit with a bad storm, as I watched the breaking weather reports on the news in the waiting area they stated that there were 60 mile an hour winds and heavy down pours and to stay away from windows. I demanded to have my vehicle back and was told the parts had not arrived. I explained multiple times that my son was stuck out in the storm under a tree and no one seemed to care. Around 12:30 I once again demanded my car or a rental, a ride something and an employee just said ""he's putting the vehicle back together"" and then ignored me. When I walked away I turned around to see him laughing. My sons life could have been in danger and they laugh at me. I called the corporate office twice and filed complaints and NO ONE has called me back. I even heard them call the store about the complaint while I was standing there.
AutoZone was the supplier of the parts that continued to bring the wrong parts to Pep Boys and took till right 12:45 to get the right parts there.
I finally was able to pick him up at 1:33 pm he had been under that tree in the storm since 11:45. He was soaked and shaking from being so cold. He tried to flag down cars, call friends and finally the police but could get a ride till I got there.
Pep Boys did not care to help me in any way nor care about my son and what was going on.

This morning, I was driving my vehicle when the oil light came one, I checked the oil and there is no oil at all on the dip stick.  Now I don't have a vehicle to drive and no one is calling me back.

Should I contact a lawyer and what type of lawyer?

"KY- Had my car Air Wrapped, but found damages and improper application after I got it back. He now refuses to give me a refund and is saying the paper I signed is not a contract.. Ok so I have been dealing with this for a week now, and things have gone nowhere. I took my car to get it air wrapped by a gentleman who had advertised on Facebook. I picked the color, dropped off the car, and waited to see how awesome my new look would be. Things started going wrong when he sent a picture and I noticed a slight discoloration. He didn't say anything about it, so I said something, and sure enough, he messed up. So thugs aren't great because we had agreed to pick up the car that Tuesday and now it is taking longer. So I pick out the new color (since he said the original was too hard) and he got to work. Well so I thought. He didn't change out the masking, and ended up ordering the wrong color without telling me (he later told me when I asked that he had tried it and it didn't work, then told me the truth that they just didn't have it in stock). So I didn't say anything other than asking why it was different. So I go to pick it up and I first see some errors. Nothing big, and stuff he said he could fix. He was in a rush, so I paid him contingent on him fixing it. Well when I get home and have a good hour to look at it, I start noticing how poorly it was done. He also had bent trim pieces, damaged the interior door handle, and got overspray all throughout the car. I approached him and asked him to explain. He said it was normal so I asked several installers who were out of state. I have over 4 people telling me it was not done right. He said he messed up on the phone, but couldn't give a refund. So I offered a payment plan. Well now he says he spoke with a lawyer and the lawyer said since the paper didn't say it was a contract it technically isn't one. I'll attach some pictures, but I'm curious if I have a case with this or if I should cut my losses. 

Forgot to add, he also removed the first covering with a large ring on (posted a video after I got the car). And I'm worried I'll find scratches underneath. Would he be liable since it was negligent to have a ring so close to car paint? Thanks!' 

Edit: added pictures with picture of ""paper"" I signed.

"I got a DUI and I'm mostly wondering what my options are.. I'm a 21 y/o male from SD just for reference. So just over a week ago I made the biggest mistake of my life I decided to get behind the wheel drunk. I've done it before after a few beers and I guess I was overly confident in my abilities and thought I was okay to drive. Well anyways I was not at all. I love about a half hour from where I was drinking in a different small town, I left town made it almost all the way to the main highway that would take me home and remembered that I wanted to stop at a store real quick and I knew the closest one closed at midnight so my idiot self decided to speed back into town and go to the store. On my way back in I passed a highway patrol and they pulled me over for going 88 in a 50 (the ticket I received says 88 in an 80 idk if that matters or not also I had an open case of beer in my vehicle but they never mentioned that). Anyways they gave me a field sobriety test and I failed pretty badly then they did a breathalyzer and I blew about a 0.22 so I was arrested and taken straight to the hospital for a blood sample and, honestly it's a little fuzzy, but I believe I asked for representation like a lawyer and they said that they would just get a warrant or I could do it right then and I said fine we'll get a warrant then. Then they took me back to the police station for some of the processing and about an hour or so after I got pulled over they served me a warrant for the blood, we went and did that and when I got back I asked for a phone call so someone could come get me or bail me out or anything and they wouldn't let me they told me I had to sober up first which i guess I understand but they didn't tell me that until after I had made a very big fuss about not getting a call. Now this was my first offense I've never been pulled over before and the only thing on my record is a seat belt violation from right after I turned 18 riding passenger in a car. I just basically wanna know what you guys think of it's even worth getting a lawyer or if I should just plea guilty to the DUI and hope they'll drop the other charges or if maybe I should try to get a suspended imposition and what hopes I might have to jump through. Anything at all will help thanks.

"I just found out that the managers of the bar I tend have been incorrectly distributing tips and have possibly take hundreds of dollars of tip money from me and given it to other bartenders.. I am in Idaho, USA. 

I've been working at this bar/restaurant for about three months. It is a corporate chain. It is unlike any other bar I've worked for in that the managers count and distribute the tip money amongst the bartenders. I actually never even see or held in my hand the entirety of the tips for any shift that I've closed. 
Tips are distributed by dividing the total tips for the night per hour, then dividing that among the bartenders on shift for the hours they work. This makes it important that the managers look at the bartenders' exact hours/minutes each shift to make sure everyone is being paid exactly what they are owed for that shift. 

I close the bar 3-4 shifts a week, usually getting there around 5:30 and leaving anywhere from 1-3 am. 
I recently realized that my managers had the tips for the shift already divided and put in our individual tip folders before I even clocked out. (While I was doing cleaning and such.) Which would make no sense, since they don't yet even know the hours I worked for that shift. 

So for the past three shifts I have compared my clock out slip to the tip sheet that we sign to say we received our tips, and on average I am being shorted for 30 minutes of work per shift. If this has been happening the whole time, it is at minimum $100 a month that I've been shorted, and probably more like $150. 

My question is, do I have a leg to stand on here? I've signed the tip sheet every time I've picked up my tips. The hours and tips for that shift are clearly written on there. I've always just counted the money I was given, and made sure it matched what the paper said I was supposed to receive. It never occurred to me to check the hours worked to make sure it was actually accurate.
I am planning to confront my GM about it tomorrow, but I want to at least kind of know if I have some good footing here. 
I have a few clock out slips that can prove maybe 3 times this has happened. Other than that, I don't know if they can print records of my shifts and how many hours they were. I don't know how far back they log the tip info either. 

I hope this all made sense! 

Thanks for any advice",0
"[California] Ex-friend asked me to buy second-hand stuff for his collection, now he won't pay me and I'm stuck with all this junk. I'm in another state, but he's in California.  We've been friends for decades, often doing business because I trade/sell memorabilia and he buys stuff for his collections.

So I've been getting stuff for him at his request, from various sources that I can't return it to: People on eBay, thrift stores, pawn shops.  Because he's always been honest, I never thought to get a written contract, so I guess you could say we had an oral contract.  (I know; normally I wouldn't be so naive, but as I said, he's been honest for decades.)

Last month, he says he won't be able to buy stuff ""for a while"", however long that would be.  He says he can't pay me because he had a large dental bill, but this is B.S.; his net worth is six figures, so this dental bill is like change he could find in his sofa.  All I was asking was $90 for the stuff he bought, and that included postage (one of the items was really heavy).

I called him to explain that this puts me in a heck of a bind, as I have bills to pay and my money is tied up in this stuff that I can't sell to anyone else.  He collects on these has-been celebrities, you see, so I'm stuck with this junk now.  He said he'd call me back the next day, but half an hour later I get a call from his crooked friend who helps him with his finances.  

The friend says to me, ""He owes you nothing!""  I asked what business is it of his, and sarcastically asked if he has power of attorney over my friend; he lied and said yes, but my friend told me that nobody has power of attorney over him.  I hung up on this liar and tried to call my friend, but he won't take my calls anymore.

I do have a little evidence that we had an agreement for me to sell him stuff every month, such as emails and the USPS insurance/postage receipts.  I could kick myself for not getting this in writing, but I never dreamed this guy would do such a thing.

Do I have any legal recourse against him?  I'm unable to travel to California to take him to small-claims court, and thanks to his actions, I don't have cash to spare, as it's tied up in his junk that he won't pay me back for.

Any insights appreciated; if any of you have additional questions for me, I'll answer them as best I can.  Thanks.",0
"Illinois, im refusing to pay rent to a slum lord that lied about fixing things, we're moving out.... Kankakee, Illinois 

Me and my fiance lived here for 3 months, the roof was leaking also the ceiling was leaking into the stove, which would smoke when turned on the oven part of it so we're scared to use it. The porch is also water damaged along with me almost falling through it.  The wall at the part of the house thats leaking is taking in water also, i put my hand on it one day to walk down the 1 foot apart death trap steps to the water leaking basement only to have the wall cave in a bit and i could hear stuff falling down it, the house wasn't inspected or anything before we moved in, we had to buy a steam cleaner and clean the nasty carpet, also painted the bedroom and re-did the flooring as well.  They never fixed anything other than putting a tarp on the roof, and has never done anything about it for a month now. 

Every time we have asked our landlord (daughter) about anything she just told us to talk to her dad about it, and then he woudn't want to do anything. We were promised gutters and a back fence that never got put up, not worried about the fence but the gutters would prevent all the water leaking into the basement and the chance for mold and whatnot, we can't use the entire house as it is and they haven't fixed anything.

We've decided not to pay rent this month and have a lease being printed out for us on the new place and are using that to put down on the deposit and rent for the new place.

They just showed up asking for the rent and we told them we didn't feel we should have to pay this month being that i can't even use the entire house and that we're moving out soon around the end of the month. 

I have taken pictures of everything and have tried to also save any conversations me and my fiance have had with this guy and his daughter.  Are we in the wrong? Should we pay rent, even though nothing got done?  My fiance is scared about going to court because they're saying they're going to put up a 5 day notice on our house and then start the eviction prosess, i mean we're gonna be gone by then but we will still have to deal with them in court.  Do we have a case or should we pay the rent and then move out?

Any help, advice, and/or information about this would be absolutely appreciated please and thank you.",1
"Put down earnest money to build a house but the lots are nothing like described.. My wife and I have decided to build a house and just by luck we stumbled upon a brand new subdivision exactly where we want to live.  The subdivision is not even being advertised yet, but we stumbled upon the brand new facebook page and contacted the builder.  Houses in this area go crazy fast, so we wanted to get in early.  He had a mockup of what the subdivision will look like with all the lots sketched up.  There are going to be 3 ponds in the subdivision so we really want a lot that backs up to one of the ponds.  It was everything we were looking for so we decided to move forward with the builder.  We put down $5k nonrefundable earnest money and have been working out all the details of the house while they have been preparing the land over the last several months.  

We decided to go out this weekend to the land to check on the progress and there is absolutely no way the lots will be anywhere close to the size of the mockup that we were shown.  The lots around the ponds look like there is barely enough room for a house to be built on let alone have any kind of yard.  Leading up to this we had asked if he could give us an estimate of lot sizes and he never would, and would just say that he would have to wait until the land is cleared, etc.  But, when we asked about fencing the back yard for our dogs, he said fencing the whole thing would be pretty expensive so we could fence it halfway and have a gate in the back so we could walk out to the pond.  We took that as it would be a pretty large lot.  Also if you compare the pictures of the lots to the pictures of the ponds, they should be pretty large.  The ponds have already been dug so its easy to see that on the mockup the lot is half the size of the pond, but in reality its not even close.

There is still a little ways to go on the land before any construction will begin, so things could always change, but with 2 dogs, a backyard is an absolute must for us.  If it turns out the lots are not even close to what we expected, would it be possible to get our $5k back?

So basically, the size of the lots was never specifically given as far as sq ft, dimensions, etc; however, using the mockup of the subdivision, an educated guess could be made.  Now the lots are not looking even close to what was expected.",1
"My girlfriend and I were victims of voyeurism. What can we do against that person?. Hello Reddit. I'm using a throwaway account to post this because it left trauma on my girlfriend and me. 

Storytime: yesterday night, since we don't have an appartment, my girlfriend (16, legal in our country, Croatia) and I (22) decided to have intercourse in my car on a spot we have used have used for the same purpose many times. It's a forest area next to a dead end road, across which there are some private properties, but the area we used is no-ones property. It was around midnight.

We had a passengers seat window opened. Before foreplay my girlfriend heard some weird rustling in the bushes around us, but ignored it and blamed it on paranoia and anxiety, and we decided it's probably just bugs or a lizard.

We did some foreplay on the passenger seat, and then moved to the back seat behind drivers seat. She was on top and after at least 10 minutes if sex, heard the rustling again, so she turned to see a man crouching inches away from the door, masturbating. She screamed at him, at which point I screamed at him too. He got up and slapped his penis against the inside of my car, proceeding to masturbate for a moment before he ran away. We didn't even get dressed just turned the car and drove away in utter state of shock and powerlessness. We stopped at the first sight of streetlights not knowing what to do. We got to her place 20 minutes later unable to fall asleep and we just talked to get our minds off that.

At one point during the night I woke up hyperventilating and crying (I don't think I even have to mention what state she was in the whole time.). The next morning I decided that I have to do something about this but since I have no friends or family who could give me proper advice on this I decided to come here and ask for advice.

Who should I call? What should I say? Is there anything we can do to get him punished?

Her mother laughed at our petrified faces because it happened to her too in her youth. She also said the police wouldn't do anything if we told them and I am scared to tell them because that might've been treated as a public place.

Tl;dr - a voyeur was masturbating to my girlfriend and i having intercourse in a possibly public place. Who do I go to for help and how?

Thanks for all replies in advance

Summary: An independent contractor, working for our company in the service industry, has been and continues to plan and execute the theft of at least $25,000. That amount is what we know of so far but it keeps getting larger. He's accepting and reporting (on weekly reports) that money is coming in (to make us think it's being collected and placed into the right account). In reality, he's having clients make out checks to him personally and depositing them into his own bank account. He's also accepting cash from clients for things that aren't being reported and further, he has clients paying for services without reporting that they exist. Again, in total that theft amounts at least $25,000.

The real question: Okay so we spoke to some police officers in CT and they said that once the warrant is out (which will take 4-6 week) they will contact the police in NY and see if they will also issue a warrant. Now, let's say there is a warrant out in CT and NY BUT they also said that they won't actually go and bring him into custody...Huh? There's an unbelievable amount of evidence we've compiled that should be more than enough to go out and bring this person in but what it seems that we're being told is ""he's basically free to be until he makes a mistake."" How can this be correct? I understand that some CT police don't want to go all the way to NY to arrest this person but, what if he's in the state? What if he happens to be in the same town? Will they take a call that says ""Here he is?"" The answer seems to be no, and my mind also seems to be blown that a criminal isn't being brought it and put through our legal system. I don't even know what the charges would be but maybe - grand larceny, fraud, damage to a business, forgery, like what would it take to mobilize and bring this person to justice? Are we just stuck with a warrant waiting for him to get pulled over for running a stop sign? There has to be an easier, more efficient, and just way to have him answer for his transgressions. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",0
"Need help with my case. Hi Reddit Lawyers. I need some advice on my case. Backstory:

April 2016- I injured my hamate bone, fracturing the hook. I did not know this until May, when pain persisted and I went to an Ortho. I had X-rays and an MRI to confirm the fracture. My ortho elected to wait for the bone to heal. Fast forward to July. Still have pain, went back to the same ortho but with a hand specialist. He also had me wait and did not perform an excision. By August, the pain was still there and I would not heal. After X-rays and a CT, we decided to excise the hamate hook. (I was told I could immediately get back to sports and life as soon as the incision healed, but that story kept changing as I followed up the procedure and had pain. Being told I could participate quickly is something for another time).

After waiting a few months with no activity, my wrist was feeling ""better."" I was not having the same pain. On July 3rd, the same pain came back. After X-rays, MRI, and CT, it was shown that my hamate hook was still there. Only half was removed. The same fracture site existed with only the tip missing in the images. I went to a new ortho and recently had the rest removed. 

The standard of care for this injury is to excise the hook immediately based on my research. Non union rates of the fracture are as high as 90%. My new ortho also said that they do not even talk about letting it heal, that went out of date 20 years ago. The go to is excision. This is also coupled with the fact that the surgeon stated he removed the entire hook in the op report. He ""completely"" removed it and said he examined the fracture site- something not possible because the original fracture was still there. Apparently, all he did was cut the tip of the bone off. This, obviously, caused me to have a follow up procedure to fix that issue.

So I had to wait in pain and not continue my life, which was wrong to begin with, and my surgery was incorrectly performed. I spoke with a lawyer and was basically told my case isn't big enough for his firm. I plan on getting a second opinion. I would like to know what you guys think. If I can't find representation, should I send a letter to the original ortho? I would include what happened, what had to be done, the images from the CTs clearly showing the hook still there. Maybe compensation? What should I do? Thanks in advance!",0

"Rec'd payment confirmation email from new rental company but funds were not transferred out.. Hello,  

We just received a certified letter from our rental company stating that our payment was ""dishonored by [my] financial institution."" They are now demanding an additional ~$150 in fees. When we called the number on the letter, we were prompted to leave a voicemail. I left my details along with the confirmation number we had received with the payment confirmation email. We then contacted the customer service for the rental company and the rep stated that it had been denied for ""insufficient funds"" while the website states it was denied for ""closed account.""  

 1) I have $800 in privilege pay, so if I hadn't had the funds (I did), my checking account would have gone negative to pay the rent.  

2) The website deleted our saved account information so I cannot even verify the account number I used to make the transaction. All I have is the last 4 of my account number per the confirmation email, which I verified is correct.  

3) The letter demands these fees be paid within 12 days or we will be taken to court. While we can pay these fees, this is not our error as we had the confirmation email stating the payment was made.   

4) My checking account does NOT reflect that any attempt to retrieve the funds was made, however. I called to confirm this and the rental company didn't pull out any money. The funds are still sitting there.    

5) No one called us to state there was an issue with the payment. We assumed all was well as we had the confirmation email and figured it would take the typical 3-4 business days. I reasoned that with the holiday last week, things would be delayed a bit.  

6) We used my checking account for the first time instead of my fiancé's (his has never had any issue before). This is the only difference, but it still made us input the account number twice and routing number once when we entered the information initially.  
  

Questions I have: Are we responsible for these fees? Does it seems suspicious to anyone else that both of our saved bank accounts were deleted from the system so we cannot even confirm the account number from which funds were supposed to be drawn out from? We have not been able to get in contact with the woman who issued the letter (from the collections department), and the customer service line was of no help.",1
"Can I sue my (prestigious entertainment) company for discrimination?. I have a boss that intentionally leaves me out of important meetings and assignments (he makes me do all the work, but never includes me in emails or meetings); so I dont get any recognition or limelight in the corporation. To list a few examples:

He has NEVER invited me to a meeting with the head of our dept, when my peers in other depts, all do.  My boss has also said that in order for me to get promoted, I need face time with the head of the dept.  Because he has a 20+ year relationship with this executive, he doesnt want anyone else getting the attention.  

My boss has several others that work for him that manage other groups.  When we had target setting meetings with heads of each dept, I asked if I could attend and he said no one on his team would attend other than him (in other words, he would represent all of us in all meetings) - later I found out, the others did in fact attend the meetings.  Have proof of this in email.  

There was a company open call for nominees to participate in a task force - my boss sent an email to his team asking if any of us were interested.  I said i was, and he later verbally told me I couldn't because I was looking to change depts.  Which makes ZERO sense, and he is just fishing for excuses.  This task force would be me in touch with major players in the organization and I feel like he doesnt want that.  

He has made comments like: ""why is XYZ off today? they want to have a life outside of work?""....""we are glad XYZ left the company, b/c he always had family and kids issues and never worked late""

He has taken his (personal/home related) anger out on me...when I called him out on it, he said he wasn't aware he brought his personal life at work when it was utterly OBVIOUS.

He never agrees with my thoughts in meetings with others; uses sarcasm or interrupts me almost always, when others at the meeting agree with my opinions or thoughts.

Any advice would be highly appreciated.  This man has caused me serious stress. I have frequent heart palpitations resulting in appointments with a cardiologist.  I had huge nodules on my throat that ended up being benign, however doctor says they are caused by stress.  I experienced a bout of serious migraines which  led me to get a brain scan.  I'm at my dream job, but I cant handle this anymore.  Please help.",0
"Old Collections, Bankruptcy, and Credit Counseling. I am looking for advice on how to proceed with my outstanding debts from the last decade or so, and have not found a good place to get advice so figured I would try here since Credit Counselors only want to run your credit report and clean that up for you...my questions go back further than that.

So, I have been on the run from my debts for about 10 years.  Most of my debt has fallen off of my credit report, but I have a lot of money (for me...I would guess about $15-20K) still owed on these accounts that are no longer on my credit report and sold to various collection agencies.  I have moved multiple times and avoided requesting credit unless absolutely necessary (utilities, etc) to try and fall off the collection radar.  I never intended on getting credit again or buying a house, was young, and needless to say lacking foresight.

Now, it's 10 years since I ran from my debt, I have been married a few years to a woman who had a mortgage already.  We applied for a credit card 3 years ago and got approved.  It makes me nervous to have credit, and we have already managed to get ourselves into 4k worth of debt in just a few years.  We collectively also owe about 3K to the IRS we are paying off in installments as a result of our witholding being wrong for a few years but not being able to afford to correct the error.  We are no longer being undertaxed so we should work out closer to 0 this year and not go further into debt to the IRS.

My wife would like to look at selling our house and moving closer to work, but we don't qualify for good interest rates unless my income is included, but I have dings on my credit report and I don't end up helping.  I am nervous because I feel once I get assets on paper, someone might get the idea to accumulate my debt and sue me for the full amount once I have something worth taking like a house.  As of now, the house is in my wife's name.

Bottom line, what is my recourse for these old debts?  How should I go about getting them taken care of?  Is bankruptcy an option, can I do it individually, or would I take my wife down with me?  Credit counseling only wants to talk about what's on my credit report and can't answer anything about these old debts, and I would like to find out how these old demons will affect my future.  

Any advice anyone has for me would be greatly appreciated.",0
"[US] [CT?] Writing a graphic novel and need your expertise to help me work out part of the plot involving possible manslaughter in an accidental death scenario.. Probably a little bit different than the usual questions you get here, but, I'm writing a graphic novel and am having some trouble working out part of the plot.  Hope you guys don't mind helping me out.

The apparent scenario goes something like this:  While attending college, one student falls to her death from a high balcony.  The only other student there at the time does not remember what exactly happened (I know, I know,  the amnesia trope is played out, but meh &gt;_&gt;), but evidence suggests there may have been some maintenance issues on the balcony as some of the wrought iron supports or their screws were rusted through.  


That's the available apparent evidence. The actual events as I currently have them go something like this:   The two students were roommates, Roommate 1 (Let's call her Crissy. Not actually her name, but I don't want this post to be easily searchable for spoiler reasons) gets angry at Roommate 2 (Let's call her Amy)  over a misunderstanding and goes to confront Amy where she is located on an upper balcony.  They argue about misunderstanding and Crissy gets physical and attacks Amy. But Amy has self-defense training and redirects her attack such that she ends up pushing Crissy back into the balcony.  Ordinarily this probably wouldn't have been enough force to do anything except deflect the attack, but the balcony was already in a weakened state and it broke enough for Crissy to lose her balance, slip and fall over the edge, colliding with the pavement below. 

I have a few questions; How likely is it such an event would result in a manslaughter charge for Amy? If so, what sort of sentence would she be looking at?  (the plot kind of demands that she be around for the school year after, which is when the story actually takes place so I was hoping for at most maybe several months of actual jail and then probation where she would have to stay on school premises)  Would there even be any charges or is it more likely to be chalked up as an accident.  Would the school be held responsible in some way for the faulty balcony?

Anyway, thanks for your help. :D

(I never really established a location for the school, but the rules said I needed a location, so let's just say Connecticut.)",0
"Malpractice case gets shut down by medical board. I really need help, please. I don't have insurance and I visited a new doctor May 17 because I have hypothyroidism and needed a new prescription. Upon meeting the doctor (mom as my witness) I explained to him I had surgery years ago and I need a new prescription to balance out my thyroid hormone. I told him I was diagnosed in February. I explained how I had a thyroidectomy and I would need medicine the rest of my life. I also said I just need the proper blood work to determine what MG of Levothyroxine I should take, and a prescription to make it happen. I even wrote all of this on my new patient sheet. I take what I thought was the proper blood test and now I must wait. A few days pass and I get a call from a nurse or receptionist saying my blood work came back normal.. I tell her there is no way seeing that I only had one month of Levothyroxine treatment and before that my levels were dangerously low. She insists I'm fine so I hang up very confused. I call my last doctors office and they also say that is impossible and they must have tested wrong. I call the new doctors office and they tell me I was administered a General blood test. I get a little upset because I specifically told the doctor what I needed and he didn't listen. It cost me about $115 out of my own pockets, no insurance. The nurse goes on to say the thyroid blood test is about $200. I demand the $115 I paid get credited to that, the accountants response is that they already paid the outsourced lab and cannot get the money back. I say it isn't my problem they did that because I told the doctor what I needed and what disease I have and he chose to ignore me. The accountant goes on to say that the doctor doesn't have to listen to me. I wanted to speak to my doctor but the three receptionists and accountant were all I got. I reported this to the Texas Medical Board and they said the doctor referred me to an endocrinologist which is completely false and dishonest. I never spoke to him after the initial appointment, and the nurses or receptionists were insisting I was fine. 

Please somebody help me. I don't know what to do at this point. I am untreated and I feel extremely weary, I have no energy because I was left undiagnosed and untreated. I can't help but think of the other people this doctor left untreated, without their knowledge. He must be stopped.",0
"[China/Thailand] My sister, who is from Thailand, has married a Chinese man. She is about to give birth in Thailand, what would her son's nationality be?. My sister has asked me to post about this. 

• She is 8 month pregnant and is about to give birth in Thailand.

• As the title has already stated, she is Thai (Bangkok), her husband is Chinese. (Yunnan province, Kunming city)

• My sister and her husband have only sign their marriage certificate in China; they didn't sign one in Thailand.

• She has asked a Thai lawyer who is her friend about this. The lawyer has said that in China, the child can only get the Chinese passport if both of the parents are Chinese. Therefore my sister's son will automatically only be qualified for Thai nationality. The lawyer, however, does not specialize in this field of legal matters.

• On a Thai platform, another Thai woman said that she has asked the China Embassy in Thailand and they said that if the birth certificate states that the child is Thai, they can only provide China's visa with annual renewal terms. However if the birth certificate states that the baby is 'not of Thai nationality', then the embassy can provide the child with the Chinese passport so the family can bring the child back to China to continue with the proceedings. When the woman went to ask at the district office, they said that since the mother is Thai, they can only state in the birth certificate that the child is Thai and cannot state that the child is 'not of Thai nationality'.

• My sister's in-laws have told her to not get the birth certificate at all and get all the proceedings done in China so the child gets the Chinese nationality. They are trying to force/convince my sister to make her son's nationality Chinese. They are using money and legal reasons to convince her but my sister doubts their knowledges dealing with legal matters as their have previously lie and made up stories to convince my sister of various things.

Questions:
1. Will my sister's son only qualify for Thai nationality?

2. If my sister is to have more children, will the terms be different if she is to give birth in China instead of Thailand?

3. Can my nephew, who is Thai, inherit his inheritance from his father who is Chinese? (My sister is worried that they may use this as reasons to force her to give birth in China and force her son to get the Chinese nationality.)",0
"shoplifting advice, i am partly guilty - NJ. **Only serious replies please, I know I screwed up**

Hello, 

I was caught leaving a mall holding a $300 item. I desperately need advice. 

One of my relatives needed to have repair done on an item at the Apple store. The wait time was about 2 hours. We submitted our information and decided to wait. I wanted headphones for myself and my husband. I took one pair, did not get caught and decided to wait in the queue to pay for the 2nd pair. While waiting I needed to go to the bathroom and I was in line to ask how much longer the wait. During that point I had a bit of an accident since my bladder is weak after giving birth recently. I was standing right by the exit and I was embarrassed. I decided to go to my car quickly, but I did not put down the item I planned on paying for. Prior to any of this I told my relative I need to go to the bathroom and I was checking on the queue before leaving. When the the leak first started I thought it might be a gush of blood since I am postpartum then I realized it was urine. I left the store holding the item.. I realized I had the item in hand and I didn't know if I should go back or not with urine dripping down my leg. I was embarrassed and decided I will get my extra clothing, come back, and act like I was there the whole time. I'm sorry for the TMI. 

Outside the mall I was apprehended by a man dressed in casual clothes saying I was shoplifting, I told him and showed him the urine and a puddle was starting to form under me. I explained it was an error on my part but I was going to the car and planned to return which I know sounds bogus.. I gave him the item and said he could follow me to my car. I explained I was panicking about my situation. He started to get forceful and I resisted. There was no real proof he was security or anyone at that point.. despite that I still tried to explain myself and remain civil. I tried to get away from him. He caught up and put handcuffs on me and people in security outfits came at that point. I was arrested and taken to the local police department. It was written as at 4th degree for prosecution. This is my first offense and I am 36 years old with children. I was told this can get downgraded to the lower courts and etc. I'm not sure what to do at this point because I'm sure they can see on the footage I took the other item too.. I was not charged for it.",0
"[California] Tenancy Law / Want to prevent my brother from establishing tenancy in my grandma's house. The house is in a trust that I control.. My grandmother owns a house in California. She is in a memory care center with late stage Alzheimer's. I have POA on all her medical, financial and legal affairs and the house is in a trust that only I control.  
  

&amp;nbsp;

My father has been allowed to live in the house for many years. He's a disabled senior who is undergoing treatment for cancer.     


&amp;nbsp;

My brother was incarcerated about a year ago for a variety of criminal charges including weapons, possession and theft. His previous residence was raided multiple times and he squatted in the house for many months after being evicted. He was dealing drugs there.    


&amp;nbsp;

He was released from jail a few days ago. He currently has no place to live.  Many of my family members have been harassing me and trying to convince me to allow my brother to move into my grandma's house. My father does not want him there but feels pressured and obligated to help my little brother so he's reluctant to give a firm 'no'.  


&amp;nbsp;

I realize that my safest bet to protect the house is to file a restraining order. But that would involve seeing my family in court and a trip to SoCal which I try to avoid at all costs since it reminds me of the fact that I had to grow up around these people.


&amp;nbsp;

*Other relevant info- My mother is an abusive narcissist who despises that I ever have something that she can't use or destroy and even though I've told her that my grandma gave me legal control of the house, she said that what happens there is 'none of my business'. My brothers have broken valuable objects of mine when they've been angry at me for not letting them use that house. They keep dropping by the house to ask my father for a foot in the door like, ""Well can he just stay for the weekend?"" I've had to fly into SoCal on several other occasions over the past few years to sort out problems arising from my chemically-dependent brothers and their sometimes violent friends.


&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR - Can my brother establish residency in a house because my father is living there and allows him to stay? If so, how can I prevent it since I'm not physically in the location? My father is a legal tenant but I control the house.

Any help would be much appreciated!",1
"Engineer Erred and Contractor Didn't Pull Permits. This story takes place in Philadelphia, PA where I recently had a contractor underpin a portion of my home's foundation. The reason for the underpinning was a vertical crack running from the basement up to the bottom of my third floor. When I purchased the home (a little over a year ago), I paid a reputable structural engineer to evaluate this crack. He explained it was old, the house was done settling, and he didn't even want to charge me for writing up a report (I therefore only have my word and the word of my friend who was present). My question in this regard is do I have recourse? Since moving in, the crack has grown and a new engineer and an insurance agent have deemed it a structural problem in need of underpinning. Has the statute of limitations expired? Have I ruined my chances in court by having work done? What about by not possessing the original engineer's report? I have not called this engineer back, btw. On top of this debacle, the contractor who came to do work has completed its work but has not provided me with the approved plans and permits from the city of philadelphia. I have refused to pay. Although the signed contract says nothing about permits, I have email evidence in which the contractor states that permits are included in the cost of work. Additionally, the contract states that work will be performed to industry standards. Is this enough to maintain a legal case for withholding full payment (down payment was paid)? The foundation contractor is the largest of its kind in Philadelphia. The permit handler at the contractor continues to say he is trying to get the permit 6 months after the fact. I think I'm being had. I'm worried I will be charged interest for not paying in full and will be left with unpermitted work which will cost me even more money to correct and get compliant. However, I'm also assuming the contractor won't pursue me. Couldn't the contractor lose its license for not pulling permits? Should I continue to refuse to pay? Should I sue for the unpermitted work done? Will correcting this issue cost me more in the future if I don't? How should i proceed? As my home is a townhome, the work was done on a party-wall foundation which I share with my neighbor. He shared the expenses and paid in full through the contractor's financing options. What is my neighbor's path forward? Thanks for the help!",1
"Friend possibly being exploited by church management. Working 60+ hours a week. Please help.. Throwaway account to protect those involved.

A good buddy of mine has worked in management at this one place for the past twenty or so years, up until it recently moved out of state. A church has purchased the building, and has employed him to keep things in order as it is is renovated (it is becoming a headquarters for the church, as well as for a house of worship for the town). However, there are a few suspicious things going on that leave me feeling uneasy.

1. Although he is employed to be working 40 hours a week, he puts in a good number of hours of (unpaid) overtime each week, so that he is really working upwards of 60 hours a week. This is in part due to the fact that

2. in hiring him, the church had fired all of their other staff (the guy who mows the lawn, etc.) for a separate location, and is now asking my friend to manage that facility as well. Unfortunately, he's a bit of a pushover, and so he is just going along with it. So, while he is employed to be managing one location, he is really working two, without anyone under him to actually provide assistance. As such, he is doing a good deal of manual labour himself, between driving back and forth for hours between both locations. I'm worried, because his age is definitely getting to him. I fear that a few more months of this could ruin his health.

3. He is now a salaried worker of the church. However, they are consistently late with paying him. For instance, supposing he was meant to be paid on the 4th, it might be added to his account on the 7th. Usually, there is a delay of 2-4 *business days*, meaning that, when he was meant to be paid on June 30th, he only receive it on July 6th, due to bank holiday around the 4th.

Him, being the person he is, is unlikely to make a fuss about this with his management, because he doesn't see that anything is wrong. I have read up a bit about overtime exemptions for EAP employees on the DOL's website, and from what I gather, that his work primarily consists of manual labour would seem to exclude him from that exemption. The two main questions I have hear are a) is this an accurate assessment of what the DOL says about overtime exemptions in regards to the first point, and b) is there any more information I can give my friend that he can use in filing a complaint with his current employer?",0
"Employee law question. Sorry, I accidentally deleted my last post. 

Hey, y'all. Any employee law information you can give me, either state (Indiana) or federal (US), as well as any advice on resolving any legal matters as quickly as I possibly can would be greatly appreciated!

So, since I teach during the school year, I have employment over the summer with a summer camp. I signed no contract with my employers after receiving the job offer - only an employment application and information for payroll. I accepted the job on the premise that I would be paid an hourly wage as I did last year for the same job, but I was told after approximately a week of work that I would be paid a flat rate of $450/week. 

The new year also came with some new rules for the camp counselors. We cannot leave the campus without permission, and can only leave for 2 hours at night, one-at-a-time between 11PM-1AM. We were also told that we would be getting overtime pay, and if we worked overtime, to log it on the final week of the payroll cycle in which we will only be present on campus for 1 of the 7 days. 

On another note, I was offered a better position at this camp initially, and then they took the offer back to give it to another candidate after I had already made living arrangements for the summer. But I'm not sure that I can prove this/it will hold up in court.

 • Since I am required to be present unless given permission and am only allowed 2 hours per night off campus with that permission, does this mean that I am on call 24 hours? If so, can I be paid for the hours that I am not necessarily actively doing something since I am essentially required to just be around?

 • Is keeping me here for a month with no release okay? How can I get some time away from here if I want to see family or when I have to move my permanent residence in 2 weeks?

 • Do I have a case against my employer for not paying overtime and asking us to alter our time sheets even though this was discussed in a private meeting and there is no written record?

 • Can the camp be liable for my expenses since they took back a job offer after I made living arrangements? Again, I'm not really sure I can prove this part.

 • Who do I report the above issues to, and how long will it feasibly take to get fixed? Is it possible to resolve some of these issues within a couple of weeks or will I be toughing it out until the end of the camp?",0
"Regarding consumer protection laws and culpability for faulty used goods. Background: 

I'm in VA..... somehow

Some time ago I acquired a sensory deprivation tank of craigslist, originally manufactured by the esteemed Zen Float co. (ZFC)

The original kit includes some ZFC branded electronics; heater pads, an immersed pump unit, a temperature controller and two GFCIs. They're kinda shitty though - from the get go the temperature controller was hooped. 

We rolled our own controller and everything worked fine for a couple month, until one day when I was cleaning the tank, it gave me a little shock! Didn't seem that serious, but it did leave a little burn mark, and being all too familiar with how fragile attractors can be... I was compelled to run off to the ER for a quick EKG.

Grand total *after* insurance: $380ish. lol america

OK, but the thing is - even though the temperature controller was a hideous homebrewed mess, this shouldn't have been possible. The circuit was behind 2 GFCIs at the time - 'ground fault circuit interrupters' which measure the current leaving hot and returning on neutral and cut the circuit if they're not the same. A pretty catastrophic failure, especially considering there's an immersed pump! 

Questions:

So one prospect would be to sue for my medical bills, which seems like a stretch because I got it used and did have a homebrewed temperature controller*. But still the GFCI failed catastrophically and perhaps there are some applicable consumer pool electronics laws on my side. 

* just wiring for an off the shelf model... which hopefully means it's legal

I emailed ZFC and demanded remediation a while ago, and I guess was sufficiently intimidating as they offered to purchase the tank back from me, for as of yet not discussed terms. They also keep trying to get me on the phone. Smells like a settlement to me. I haven't responded yet as I wanted to get the lay of the legal land first. 

But I think more serious is that they're selling it with these GFCIs. I do have an older model, so maybe it's changed but I doubt it. I mean I know n = 1 but that's still too many for a fail-safe. 

So, actual questions:

(location: VA)
  
   - what consumer protections are there against faulty electronics? In general? In the context of pools? 
   - is it possible for ZFC to be culpable even though I bought the tank through a third party? 
   - do you accept the axiom of choice? ;)",0
"Wedding Photo Disaster. I hired professional, highly recommended photographers for my wedding in January 2017. They gave me a CD with 1,331 photos. There are 3 of the bride (me) and the editing on the rest of the pictures is terrible (they also gave me photos of them drinking, the sky, and selfies with the staff, there are more photos of the sky than me, the bride, alone in my dress). The best photo these professionals took was from their iPhone. When I received the photos I told them right away that I wasn't pleased. The editing is terrible, they just applied filters to most of the photos. I asked them to removed the filters, look for more photos of me, and to find more photos like the cell phone photo they took (the cell phone picture is a stunning full body shot of the bride and groom with the lake and sunset in the background). The professional camera shots of the same image are from the shoulders up and very washed out due to filters. They said they would. A month goes by I hear nothing so I reach out to them and ask how its going. They say we have all the pictures done. I'm thrilled and I go and get them. It's a CD with 7 photos, I told them there was more they said they would fix, they asked for a detailed list. I spent 3 weeks making a ""This is what a professional would do to make these photos great list."" I covered everything from ""Please crop this photo, photoshop food out of bridesmaids teeth in group shots, remove filter etc."" They said that was too much work and they don't use photoshop (not mentioned before booking or anywhere in the contract). I told them to just give me the photos unedited and I would have someone else fix them. Months go by again and they give me 50 photos, they went though the list I gave them and gave me unedited images of things I wanted cropped. They did not remove filters. Then when I brought up that they mentioned they found more photos, the denied that they said that because they gave me all they had (I have the text message from them where they said they found more images). My question is: Is it worth it to take them to small claims for all the photos unedited (raw). I'm not wanting money, though I do have to pay an editor now. Just give me the SD cards from the wedding and let me be on my way. They already gave me a copyright release form stating the photos can be edited by an outside party. It's been months and I really want photos I can show people.",0
"Visitation pick up/drop off. Separated from ex for about four years now. We decided to attempt filing for a non contested divorce without the assistance of an attorney. We agree on everything with the exception of who will drive for pick up and drop off during visitation. We really can't get past this and I think it's probably going to result in a contested divorce in front of a judge. 

A little background; I'm a mother of five children ages 2-10, three are half siblings and step siblings from my current relationship. We alternate holidays and he gets every other weekend with the option to see them whenever he's in the area. Neither of us is too firm on the visutation schedule, we just do whatever works. 

In the four years that we've been sharing custody the kids have never been picked up or dropped off on time. He's picked them up as late as 3am and brought them home as late as 4am on a school night. It's become a huge problem and source of tension. He blames it on my location, says I live too far away but in the four years that we've been separated I've lived in one home while he's lived in several. Whether he's staying with family, friends, in temporary rentals or hotels, I can't be blamed for not consistently living within an appropriate distance from him. 

Currently he lives about an hour and 45 minutes away. He wants to meet halfway for pick up and drop off. Under normal circumstances I would agree that that is fair but I've been there and done that with him. In the beginning I would meet him and we would sit in the car for *hours*, sometimes very late into the night waiting for him to show up. I tried bringing them to his house and still, I would sit for hours, waiting. Eventually I stopped meeting him and now it's becoming an issue of him bringing them back at all because he doesn't want to drive. They'll be due back on Sunday and he'll repeatedly say he's coming but not actually show up until several days later.  It's driving me crazy not having a consistent routine and I realize that something needs to be put down on paper so that everyone is equally liable.

 In a contested divorce will a judge consider the circumstances before ruling on who should do the driving? Honestly the reason I've put this divorce off for so long is that I'm worried a judge will order me to share driving duty and I can't- I just can't- spend every other weekend sitting in a car with my 5 kids waiting on him for hours.",0
"""NEED IMMIGRATION LAWYER ADVICE""How diversion(Misdemeanor possession of illegal drugs(weed) and paraphernalia) in Lenexa KS affect immigration status?. I got my 2 years green card through marriage to Citizen, and it is expiring on August. I need to apply for the 10 years green card soon.

"[FL] Homebuilder didn't allow time for foundation to dry. Offered to pay to repair a section, which was signed for. Didn't realize it exonerated them from any future damage and prohibited me from speaking about it.. I am writing on behalf of a close friend. Her husband passed away rather dramatically and unexpectedly and she was forced to sell her old home and move into a new one. The company responsible for building this home we'll call Homes Inc. Where we live in Florida it rains a lot. Apparently when they put down the concrete foundation or the ""slab"" as they call it, they didn't allow it enough time to dry before they started putting the flooring in. Not long after she moved in, floor boards literally started to come apart as they became warped by water from underneath and the glue came undone. She spoke to Homes Inc. and they offered her $2,000 dollars for repairs to the floor in the areas where the leaks had happened. Keep in mind, this is still just a few months after her husband passed away and her whole world got turned upside down. She does not have experience with this sort of thing as her husband was the one to handle this kind of business. So she signed the very long paper and accepted the money. This money was not intended for any repairs to the concrete slab, it only paid to replace the damaged floor boards. What she failed to realize at the time was the true intent of this payoff. The document stated that Homes Inc. was exonerated from any blame for any future damage coming from this problem. It also said she was not allowed to speak to anyone about this or they could sue her. Now it's been months and she still gets leaks all over the house, in her bedroom, in her office, in the living room, in the kitchen. It's far and above a $1,700 job to repair and she feels terrible and trapped. She feels like she was completely deceived since they told her that the areas would dry out over time, yet this has clearly not been the case. She doesn't know what to do and quite frankly neither do I. I know hardly anything about the legality of all this, but I know the fact that she signed that document isn't a good sign.

Does she have any chance at legal action against Homes Inc. for repairs to her home? Who or what kind of lawyer would she need to speak to? I've heard of certain legal scenarios where the lawyers work for a share of the winnings. She doesn't have the money for a long and lengthy legal dispute, but could this be an option for her?",1
"For anyone planning on fighting a restraining order. Minnesota: Feel free to delete this if it's not allowed. Obviously this isn't a question, but I think it's information that could be helpful.

After years of butting heads back and forth with someone, we got to a point where a restraining order was put into place. We have emails back and forth for almost a decade fighting- never any physical threats, just verbal assaults. Eventually, I filed a police report against this person. In retaliation, this person filed a restraining order against me.

I got a lawyer and we had our day in court. For anyone who is in this position I want to give the most broad synopsis of what happened, and what I firmly believe will likely happen with your case. The judge doesn't listen to any reason as to why you have contacted the person who requested the order. None of that matters when you are in a position where someone is claiming any level of harassment. In my case, if I had filed first the judge would have granted the order for me against the other person. The fact that you have responded to someone else's initial actions doesn't matter, only what the judge sees as harassment against the original filer. It's safe to say the judge probably realizes there are actions on both sides and doesn't need to waste time listening to it all if they can see any sort of harassment one way.

To make it even more simple, it's like this: Person A punches person B. Person B punches person A. Person A files a restraining order. The likelihood of that order being granted is high. Both people don't get along and one restraining order will keep these people from contacting each other and in the eye of the law it doesn't matter who files because a restraint order is universal. The court doesn't care what it looks like as far as who filed against who. Only the fact that there is any proof of animosity that is patterned and has potential to escalate.

The fact that you were antagonized or provoked into hitting Person A doesn't matter in a court of law- the judge won't hear it. It *only* comes down to who is filing the restraining order and what the defendant did. 

I hope this saves someone a thousand dollars in legal fees- I wish someone had told me this, it would have saved me quite a lot of grief in the last few months. If you have a different opinion I would love to hear it, because it certainly seemed like my case would be universal to how all of these issues are handled by a judge.",0
"Flooded and ""totaled"" vehicle refused by insurance company.. My Ford F250 flooded in the Louisiana flooding in August 2016.  I called and turned the claim into insurance company immediately.  An adjuster came out and gave a “basic” estimate and said the mechanic shop we chose to take it to would check it over more and see what else needed to be done.  The shop and the adjuster decided it could be “FIXED” instead of totaled out. Small things were done here and there to ""fix"" the truck but it never ran right again and when I would get it back it would break again days after leaving the shop. I decided that the Ford dealership was apparently not going to be able to resolve anything as this had been months of back and forth so it was then brought to a diesel mechanic shop, after finally finding one that would accept the job (most places would not even accept the truck because ""it should have been totaled""). The diesel mechanic said, as the others did, that this was a vehicle that needed to be totaled, he told me and he told the insurance company multiple times. They always denied totaling the vehicle because they ""Goggled it and it could be fixed"". 
I submitted a claim to the Louisiana Dept of Insurance and after a month they decided it a closed case as there was ""no proof that water got into the engine"" and caused the truck to be damaged beyond repair.   
Now this is where I am completely lost, I have a ""totaled' vehicle (even though the insurance company refuses to total it, it is still just a sitting hunk of truck). It now sits at the mechanic shop because it will need to be towed away and this man has been nice enough to let it stay there as we were in the middle of disputes with the insurance company. His next ""fix"" will cost 5k and may or may not fix this truck, his thinking is more likely NOT. I am completely tapped as I have bought a ""cheap"" car to get me by and it is constantly needing this or that done to it as it is a 1986. BUT my 250 is still financed through the bank and pay off is over 22k. 
Is there anything that I could do to try to get out from under this truck? It's ruined so it is not worth anything at all but still has a 22k price tag on it. I have considered letting it be repossessed but that sounds like the worst idea possible for my credit. I just don't know if there is anyway at all to get out of this without ruining my credit, I am now in a huge financial bind with no vehicle and no where to turn. Any advice would be great",0
"Fired from my serving job and replaced by a young lady. So while I wasn't the only Mexican or ethnic person In the restaurant I was the only one working front of house as a server and one of only two at the times male servers. So what happens is I had been stuck being the only person who hosted for them for some reason even though everyone used to have to do it depending on who's turn it was. And also was promised better hours during the summer and instead got the two hosting shifts for Friday and Saturday(which are the best days to make tips) and serving sundays and mondays and almost always being called off of my shift because the place wasn't busy. Needless to say I wasn't making a livable wage being stuck with those shifts. And then I requested a day off for my best friends wedding and was told "" yeah you can do that but when you come in next we're going to have to have a chat about sticking to your schedule since you're asking for more hours"" which really confused me since my other coworkers would take whole weeks off and never reprimanded for it. So I went in the next pay day since I was off work and said I was ready for the talk which he proceeded to say he wasn't ready for the rest of the week. When I came into work for my next check before I even go to far past the front door he rushed me and asked me to follow him where he said ""I think it's best we go our separate ways."" And handed me a
Check for 24 dollars. And a few points I'd like to add is that I never got a single bad review which I was proud of seeing as I'd never been a server before this place. And I was secret shopped more than people who had been working there since the brewery opened and would score 100% every time and win growlers. Apparently my last
One I got which was also the week before I got fired wasn't just good and 100% according to him it was ""glowing"" and I received a 50 dollar bonus for doing so. And I should also mention the man I'm talking about was the places director of operations since his general manager had quit. Not only did he fail at his job as a director of operations  skill set needed(expert communicator, expert of delegating work) he was even worse at being the general manager. So I guess what I'm asking for advice on would whether or not I should go speak to a lawyer about this or if I'd even have a case. And Itd be for laws in Oregon.

"[WA, King County] Breaking an apartment lease with 1 month left. We are currently in the process of buying a house and set to close on it by mid-November. Our lease contract includes a fee of $3450 for early termination. When asked about this, the reply was that it will not be prorated for the remaining months left on the contract and that a total of $3450 plus any remaining rent and damages will be due at the time of lease termination. Below is the specific clause in the contract:

EARLY MOVE-OUT. You'll be liable to us for a reletting charge of
$3450 if you:
(1) fail to give written move-out notice as required in paragraphs 23
or 37; or
(2) move out without paying rent in full for the entire lease term or
renewal period; or
(3) move out at our demand because of your default; or
(4) are judicially evicted.
The reletting charge is not a cancellation fee and does not release you
from your obligations under this Lease Contract.
Not a Release. The reletting charge is not a lease cancellation fee or
buyout fee. It is an agreed-to liquidated amount covering only part of our
damages, that is, our time, effort, and expense in finding and processing
a replacement. These damages are uncertain and difficult to ascertain—
particularly those relating to inconvenience, paperwork, advertising,
showing apartments, utilities for showing, checking prospects, office
overhead, marketing costs, and locator-service fees. You agree that the
reletting charge is a reasonable estimate of such damages and that the
charge is due whether or not our reletting attempts succeed. If no amount
is stipulated, you must pay our actual reletting costs so far as they can be
determined. The reletting charge does not release you from continued
liability for: future or past-due rent; charges for cleaning, repairing,
repainting, or unreturned keys; or other sums due.
Lease Buy Out. If you desire to buy out your Lease Contract early please
refer to your Lease Buy Out Agreement. If you have not been provided
with a Lease Buy Out Agreement you must contact us regarding such an
agreement. A lease buy out may not be available in all cases. Other than
as required by law or otherwise stated in this Lease Contract the Lease
Buy Out Agreement shall govern the means by which you may terminate
this Lease Contract before the end of its term.

My question is, can they do this? My lease will be up in January, we'll be moving out mid December, and I've been a tenant here for 3 years with no defaults (not that that means anything).",1
"If someone agrees to cover travel/accommodation expenses for a trip, waits until the trip begins, then refuses to pay, can you sue for the expenses you had to pay for?. I am from Ohio, I recently took a trip to California to meet a guy online. I'm young and stupid I know. He continuously asked me to come see him and explained he had the money to pay expenses, I have a job and a small amount of savings, but it wasn't in my budget to make a trip so he insisted he would pay.

He wanted me to visit and explained that he would cover the cost for me to get back home, and pay for any expenses while I visited. I have this conversation saved from skype logs. I also state several times that I don't really have the cash to spend on any expenses if I do come, and he said he would pay for everything no problem, accommodations and the flight back, so I agreed.

The day of my flight to California I texted him to confirm that he could still host me, still wanted me to come, and could still afford everything. I even told him if money was an issue for him we could reschedule and I could meet him another time.

I got on my flight, and when I landed and called him he told me his check didn't go through, and that I was on my own. I have his address, his full name, as well as some of his family members added on Facebook.

I have incurred costs from a hotel, as well as a very expensive flight back home 2 days later. I had planned to stay 2 weeks, but since he would not even agree to meet out of embarrassment I decided to leave ASAP.

Could I legally take him to court because he agreed over text and email? I had asked him multiple times, as late as before I even boarded the plane to make sure he still wanted me to come and was able to host me during my stay. 

I wouldn't have got on the plane if he had just told me he didn't have the money. I'm incredibly upset by the whole situation and at this point I just want the money back for the 2 nights at the hotel and the flight back home. 

Would suing him in small claims be realistic or do verbal or text agreements not hold up in small claims court?

 I have him plenty of oppurtunities to speak up and potentially mitigate and costs I would incur but he literally waited until he knew I was on my way. The last text I got before landing was ""are you ok the plane?"" To which I told him I was boarding. I honestly think the guy did it purposefully. Do I have a chance at winning a suit against him if I file? The total cost for the 2 nights and the flight was $976.40.",0
"Does this lease agreement sound legit? Desperate - time sensitive.. I am moving to Seattle next month and have found a listing on Craigslist for a reasonable short-term lease. I am on the other side of the country and very afraid of getting scammed, so I would really appreciate your advice, as I have searched everywhere and need to make a decision very soon! 

What I have done to avoid getting scammed is (thank you, reddit, for the advice btw):

- had a friend in Seattle go and see the apartment, shown by the same person I spoke to over the phone - she said he seems legit, and the apartment was definitely the same on I saw listed online, same address too
- person sent me a signed lease that is very clear about the terms and seems legitimate (RHA template), after I did an application and he said my credit/background check was fine
- asked person to verify his identity - he sent me a picture of his driver's license, although with his license # and address blacked out
- Googled the hell out of everything I can to verify that he exists (he is listed as a previous tenant of the address on one of those personal info websites but has a generic name so can't find much else), and that the company on behalf of which he is signing the lease actually exists

The thing is, the property owners (it's a small, multi-unit property in Capitol Hill) are a family that have established a LLC to rent out the units, and he claims to be the property manager for 13 years running, and rents out this one furnished unit on a short-term lease because he gets a cut of the monthly payment for having furnished it. But he is not able to show me anything verifying that he has permission to rent out the unit or that he works for this LLC, despite my repeated requests. He claims that the owners are in their 70s and very low-tech and even his paystub doesn't have the company name on it. 

He wants me to send $1000 through Paypal as a deposit to hold the unit, and I have the signed lease in his name, with the LLC listed as the owner, as proof of...something? But should I take the risk? *Is* there a risk - or am I overreacting? 

THANK YOU IN ADVANCE, REDDITORS!

TL;DR I have a signed lease from a guy who claims to manage an apartment for the owners, but is unable to provide anything that explicitly proves that he has permission to rent it. Friend met him to see the unit, and the company on the lease does exist, just not sure he is allowed to sign/rent on their behalf. Do I send him a $1000 deposit or nah? Thank you!!!",1
"My Landlord is making changes to our building/street for the worse, is there anywhere I can report him?. Hi everyone! This story takes place in Los Angeles, CA.

To spare you some reading time, I'll present some bullet-points about my landlord to give you all an idea of who I am dealing with: 

- Lost in court against my former neighbors after it was found that he was illegally raising their rent. Was forced to pay over $5,000.

- Berated another tenant for not paying him on the 1st of the month (even though she left her check in the dropbox at 10pm on the 1st) and insulted her special needs son.

- Attempted to evict another tenant and gave her 14 days to leave the premises under threat of keeping the entirety of her security deposit. She ended up calling the Sheriff and was able to remain in the building...she still left as soon as she could.

- Complained to tenants about all of the legal fees he's accrued and why this caused him to raise costs in our Laundry Room. 

- Took out the grass in the front of the building and paved it over to create a parking spot without any notice of the intensive construction to tenants. We had to use milk crates as steps during this time and dirt was caked over anything that was left outside the building...our cars in the carport included.

Now, my question is related to the last issue. The area in which he created the driveway to the new parking spot is next to a street sweeping sign put in place by the city. Today, I was awakened by the sound of a saw and, when I looked out over my balcony, I saw my landlord removing the street sweeping sign. He quickly replaced it with two new signs: one that states ""Active Driveway: Tow-Away Zone"" and another that says ""No Parking Anytime"". They look authentic but were definitely put in place by him.

Now, I get that he's got a right to create this driveway, however, he placed the sign in front of a perfectly good parking space. As some of you might not know, street parking in Los Angeles is hard to come by and finding parking on our street is damn near impossible. My roommates and I only get two parking spaces for our 3 Bedroom apartment so we utilized this space often, usually the moment it opened up after street sweeping.

So, can I report him removing the street sweeping sign? I also don't think he got a permit for the construction of the driveway, can I report this as well? Or am I an asshole tenant and is this just a lost cause and I should just look into new apartments even sooner than I was planning to?",1
"Living in apartment complex &amp; requested maintenance 3+ times with no response from management (FL). Hey guys, I need your help as I am super frustrated and losing my patience with my apartment complex.

I am currently living in an apartment complex in Florida. They recently came in to install ""updates"" to my apartment. The current one involved an upgrade to my kitchen. After they finished their install, the garbage disposal ceased to work. I assume it had to do with the install as it stopped working the day they finished the work. I submitted a service request soon thereafter along with another one for an exterior light outside my apartment that is out and leaves the hallway pitch black. A week went by with no response. I placed another request for the same services. Another week went by without a response. 
I decided to email the front office staff through the portal we use to communicate/pay rent etc. with a letter regarding my disappointment with the lack of communication on their part and expressing my dissatisfaction. No response but the following day they sent out a maintenance worker to check out and I assume fix the problem. He came in and took a look and said, it seems to be an electrical issue and he'd need to come back the following day with his supervisor but that he would fix the exterior light now. 

It's been 4 days and no one has shown up and my exterior light is now flickering but still not at all well enough to see leaving my wife, dog, and I stumbling around in the dark where there is a set of stairs we need to go down. And the dishwasher now has a puddle of water at the bottom that won't drain. 

They even had the audacity to send me an email saying the service request was completed. My wife went in and talked to them Saturday showing them all the emails and request we put in as well as pictures of what's happening. They said they would send someone out Monday to fix it. But with all the nothing they've done, I have lost all faith in them to complete it in a timely manner.

What can I do to get them to actually complete the requests. What are my options legally if any? 

tl;dr: Apartment complex ignoring all requests for servicing a maintenance issue caused by their work done in my apartment and now appliance is deemed unusable and hallway outside leading to staircase is left pitch black and dangerous. What are my legal options to get them to complete the requests?

Thanks for the support. I just want to walk down my stairs with light and not have an unusable dishwasher.",1
"Landlord is asking us to do tasks for security deposit. Hey guys,
First submission, so excuse me if this is the wrong place or I did something against reddit rules.

Background- we left 6/23 and the Landlord has us pay for the full month. He originally called this a ""cleaning fee"" when we asked him why we would not be prorated(this was right before the beginning of June that we asked). The guy is a chill dude, he wasn't overly invasive or anything and seems pretty fair. He didn't take any money off for a scratch of paint in one of the bedrooms, nor from some scratches on the hardwood floor. We cleaned the house spotlessly (the last roommate to leave was supposed to get the oven and bathtub and didn't), just so that he didn't have a reason to take anything off of the security deposit... Not because we knew it was obligated to clean everything spotlessly or else get money deducted. 

Anyway, I call him a couple hours ago and he stated we didn't clean the oven or the bathtub so we could either clean it or be deducted money from the security deposit. I said, ""You said that we were being charged over $300 dollars for a cleaning fee, we cleaned everything just to be nice. Why do you need us to clean these things if we paid you $300 for you to do it?"" He said he didn't originally call it a cleaning fee and that 7 days was his time to get everything ready for the next renters. We bantered for awhile about why were are covering his time and whatnot to no conclusion.

I'm just curious if he can just make us pay for the seven additional days that we didn't live there? I see that he is, in his eyes, being""nice"" to allow us to clean it so it isn't out of our security deposit, but can he actually do that? Because the lease doesn't say we DON'T have to pay for the full month, it's my guess that he can charge us for the full month?

Probably important information:
-This was in Michigan.
-(I don't have the lease on me, I won't have it until tomorrow, but we thoroughly checked it for loop holes when this all started... I'm still lost so turning to reddit) However, the lease didn't state anything about a cleaning fee. It also didn't state that we would or would not be paying for the full month of June. The lease agreement did say that it was from 8/1/16-6/23/17.  It also gave us information that if we wanted to move in a couple days earlier we would be prorated for each day we moved in early at the beginning of the lease.

Thanks for the help and hopefully I don't fall asleep if anyone needs any further information.",1
"My parents signed a 5-year loan payment that they can not get out of. Now the business seems to be closed and their account is still being charged.. Alberta, Canada.

Back in September 2014, my mom got a call from this company that wanted to introduce an online tutoring service. My mom was interested so she invited them to our home. My parents spoke to the sales lady for about four hours and signed contracts with them that same day.

One month after using it, my siblings and I found the program really generic and unhelpful so we asked our parents to cancel it. A sales person came to our home again to ask us about our problems with their services. They only called back to say that there is no possible way to cancel it.

In the contract that my parents signed for the buyers right to cancel, it specifically says: ""If you do not receive the goods or services within 30 days of the date stated in the contract, you may cancel this contract within one year of the contract date. You lose that right if you accept the delivery after 30 days. There are other grounds for extended cancellation.""

The issue:

This part is important!!! In the contract to pay each monthly Loan payment of $183 for a term of 60 months it says: *""We are aware that other than the cancellation rights contained in the Notice of Buyers Right to Cancel, which are outlined on the Purchase Order, we cannot cancel the purchase and/or the Loan.* I also acknowledge and agree that no representative of __company name___ has promised or represented to us that we may cancel the Purchase and/or the Loan."" (they signed this the same day as the buyers right to cancel contract). 

To be sure, does that mean my parents signed a contract making them unable to terminate the contract? It sounds like my parents are surely bound to this for two more years, but still, I want to ask because I want to be hopeful, is there any way to cancel this? In the end, it's going to be a financial loss of almost 11 thousand dollars...

According to BBB the company ceased operations but say customers are still receiving customer service from another company based in a different province. The customer service is a joke. That same company has received over a hundred bad reviews on google experiencing the same problem as us. I notice that the company seems to target low-income or immigrant families which make them easier to fool. It's really unfortunate. 

 Do my parents have ANY recourse in this situation? Thanks in advance for any guidance. Sorry if the format is really bad.",0
"[MI, USA] Adult friend's mother is claiming to have paperwork proving legal guardianship over her. For context, my friend turned 18 at the end of October 2016. This drama didn't begin until well after that, around March 2017. 

Her mother and step-father are not nice people, nor are they particularly intelligent (I'm putting this very, *very* lightly). For years, she's been told by doctors that she has both depression and anxiety (unmedicated until a couple weeks ago), but due to religious reasons/political differences, her mother insisted she be tested for autism. So she was, and the results came back saying that she has provisional aspergers; this means that she showed some symptoms, but those could just be byproducts of her unmedicated depression/anxiety combo. Her mother does not seem to grasp this at all, and insists that she 100% has autism, treating her as if she's a young child. 

During a certain event a month ago (far too long to explain here, as it goes too far off topic), police were intervening, and her mother was howling about how she had paperwork proving that my friend cannot make her own decisions (we were trying to pick her up to take her to a comedy show), so she cannot decide to leave with her friends, and threatened to press charges on us for attempted kidnapping. She merely showed the cops the paper that diagnosed my friend with provisional aspergers and the cops had her go home with her parents, no other arguments permitted. 

However, after chatting with someone this week whose parents/younger brother have actually gone through the process of gaining legal guardianship over someone 18+ years old, it came to my attention that her mother might be lying, or that she's forged some documents. We're not sure. I've done some light digging (some of which was very confusing to read), and it seems that, on the basic level, certain paperwork needed to be submitted, court dates needed to be set up/attended, and above all else, my friend should have been informed that all of this was happening (if it actually was). She received no notice whatsoever of anything like this. 

So my big question here is: Is it AT ALL possible that her mother was able to sneakily obtain the legal stuff necessary with ZERO consent or knowledge from my friend, since she is not a minor? (And a second less pressing question, which you can ignore if you want since it's not the main focus: Are there any important things we should keep in mind if her mother presses this further, or if there's a confrontation over it?)",0
"Apartment issues - bug infestation (Texas). What can I do?. I have lived in the same apartment for 1.5 years and my renewed lease began July 1 (1 year lease). Coincidentally, I have been having bug issues since the beginning of July. I think it begins in early June when I heard an animal crawling in my wall. I made a service request to get it removed and the response was along the lines of, ""yes we have received multiple calls on multiple buildings with animals but there's nothing we can do this evening."" I think it died in my wall.
Fast forward to early July, I begin to see big flies in my apartment, 1-3 at a time, as days past upwards of 5 flies. I keep killing them and think maybe it's the Texas heat bringing flies inside. I go buy fly strips, request a pest spray in my apartment and hope for the best. The repeat flies go on for a week or so and I continually look for cracks, open windows - nothing. My girlfriend starts to complain about a musky smell, I may be used to it at this point. Then one night I come home late and there are over 30 flies in my apartment! I couldn't believe it. I pack a bag and go to my friends house. 
The next day I make an online service request and go to the office face-to-face. I bring up the fact that I made an animal request because I heard one in the walls a month ago and maybe it died. She said they could be it, they spent over $15k to patch holes in roofs and set traps (I want to call her fib because I don't believe they did) and the best they say they can do is go in my apartment and cut holes in the walls and maybe find something. They do and ""don't find anything"". The flies are swarming toward the window, and before anyone asks yes I am fairly clean as I don't leave food out, clean my dishes and occasionally leave a dish to be cleaned later in my sink. This is 30 flies. I have to stay at a friends for the next few days, and tomorrow (Monday) they are going to fog and clean my apartment, I have stayed one night because the flies are now gone I find that strange and now I'm worried they've laid eggs everywhere. 

Now I'm dealing with carpet beetles. Small bugs keep poking up from the carpet and I keep vacuuming them up. I've had enough of this, I truly want to leave this apartment. Either a new complex or new apartment. What are my rights in this situation? Or, if I can't move, how do I make certain these issues are resolved?

"My father was overcharged for a ""brand new"" phone he bought. Don't know how to proceed.. So yesterday my father came home with a ""Brand new"" Samsung Galaxy Note 5 that he purchased at a local cellular and mobile phone service store.  While he was setting up his phone I noticed that the phone he had just bought did not come with the original Samsung box. Which seemed a bit strange to me since he claimed that the phone was brand new. I asked him if that was the box the phone came in with and why it was not the original samsung box. He was dumbfounded after I showed him that every brand new samsung phone comes in with a samsung box. (I showed him unboxing videos on youtube of the same phone) I then asked him how much he had paid for the phone and if he was given a receipt for his transaction.  He apparently paid $500 cash for the phone and was not even given a receipt. 

At this point the entire thing seemed pretty shady to me. But my dad dismissed my concerns and gave the store owner benefit of doubt and went to work. I decided to visit the store where he had purchased this phone and asked them why my father was not given the receipt for the phone that he had just bought. After pressing the matter I was provided with the receipt which my father had apparently ""Left behind."" But upon asking them why a ""Brand new phone"" was missing its original box I was kindly met with ""Get the fuck out of my shop."" and all of my requests for a potential refund were denied except for in store credit.
After looking at the receipt I found that it was missing any tax information and was showing an amount paid of $425 when my father paid $500 in cash.

When I got home I went through the contents of the box the phone came in with and found an amazon return slip. I believe that the store most likely bought a used phone on amazon and passed it off as brand new and sold it for $500 to my dad. I looked up  [Samsung Galaxy Note 5](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-SM-N920A-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B013XB5L1A/ref=sr_1_1?s=wireless&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1500305135&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=samsung+galaxy+note+5+unlocked) on amazon and a brand new one costs about $359 which I assume comes with the original box and it has free shipping. 

I really don't know how to proceed at this point. Any help will be greatly appreciated. 

p.s We live in Queens, NY.

TLDR; My father bought a brand new samsung phone for $500 which did not come with the original samsung box and the receipt provided by the store does not reflect the correct amount paid.",0
"[DC, US Gov't] Agency doesn't do ADA, try again? Other resources - legal or other?. throwaway account. Apologies for the length.

**tldr:** I am being forced to work again with an HR person who, in the past, refused to do his job and put my physical safety at risk. How do I protect myself this time with documentation in case I need to go to a lawyer? Are there other resources for disabled people?


I work for the Federal government, and my agency is headquartered in Washington, DC.  According to the agency's internal website, we have a Disability Office whose role is to help disabled employees determine reasonable work accommodations with their managers. 


**PAST EXPERIENCE:** A few years ago, I was injured and needed ""reasonable work accommodations"" to enter and leave my office building, because it was not wheelchair accessible.  Of the Disability Office, Mr.X, wrote me *in writing* that the office's role was *not* to assist disabled employees and Managers, but to file paperwork for OPM.  My manager and I stopped working with this office and tried to figure this out on our own.  At the time, I was in too much physical pain and not in Washington, DC, so I wasn't able to figure out how to escalate this.


**PRESENT EXPERIENCE:** Fast forward to the present, I have another medical issue requiring ""reasonable work accommodations.""  Against my desire, I was forwarded to the same Disability Office. And then was told I was assigned to work again with Mr. X.  I emailed his Manager and requested a transfer, sharing his prior communication. The Manager disregarded my request, stating the office now cares about customer service, and Mr X is timely with his reports.  Subsequently, Mr. X emailed me, claiming to be ""delighted"" to meet and work with me, and asked me to fill out more forms. 


I am distraught that I will again waste precious time and resources to work with Mr. X when I need to focus on my health. But this time, I'm now back in Washington, DC, and would like to be prepared to bring this to a lawyer, if needed.  


How shall I best document my interaction with Mr. X, especially if this needs to be taken to a lawyer?  In my reply back, should I acknowledge the past communication? I don't want to lie, and claim I look forward to working with him, because then they could claim that I was satisfied with his prior help.... does this make sense?  Also, are there other groups that help disabled people receive ADA services? Lastly, do you think I have any recourse for the Disability Office's and Mr. X's past refusal of service?",0
"Tennants in common, one person wants us to buy her out and we cannot afford it, what can we do?. My family is part of a 'tennants in common' summer house. It was first owned by my mother's aunt who passed away and gave it equally to her family. There are seven 'shares' and for those that don't know, tennants in common mean that each of us own it 100% equally.

The shares were first divided as: 

My mom (M) =1.5 shares

Sister 1 (S1) = 1.5 shares

Sister (S2) = 1 share
 
Aunt1 (A1)= 1 share

Aunt2 (A2) (has 2 shares after her brother died)

1. Aunt2 is also the 'head' leader with everything in her name because she was the closest to the house, had the time and energy to run the bills and we all paid the bills to her and she was so brilliant with everything running smoothly.

2. Aunt2 has developed Alzheimers and is now being taken care of by Aunt1. Legally, everything has been turned over to Aunt1 since she is the primary caretaker.

3. Aunt1 is going through legal troubles (a foundation company accidentally did something to her basement and caused her house to collapse, so she's in that legal battle that may not be over for a couple years and she is literally living off of Aunt2's money (who was always very good at managing her money and has quite a nice amount).

4. She also recently divorced JUST before her house collapse and was old fashioned and never had to work before, so now that she's in her 60s she isn't exactly able too. So she doesn't really know how to get money except from sueing everyone. she's stressed out from taking care of Aunt2 full time, and has finally reached a breaking point that she no longer wants part of this precious house that we all own. So she has decided to sell it/ make us buy her out or-else.

5. Because Aunt1  is legally in charge of Aunt2, that also means she technically has 3 shares. So she's trying to make us buy out all three shares even though the rest of us desperately want to keep this. It's been in our family for almost a century. Aunt2 is unfortunately so far gone that she cannot understand what is going on and can't stop her.

We have been battling this issue since last summer and we are truly worried we might actually lose this house, despite four shares  wanting to 100% keep it. My twin and I were both proposed to there, my big sister was married there, and we've had so much life lived there that we all want to do anythig to keep it, we can't afford the $50k x 3, for those shares.

"Master Tenant lied about landlord coming over, is trying to evict us instead (SF, CA). Hello! So I live in San Francisco, CA in the Richmond district. I just moved into a new place as of the 3rd and am sharing a bedroom in a 4bd/1bth unit with a roommate from the previous place. Today, the master tenant texted me directly and asked that me and my roommate be out of the house from 9 pm to 10 pm as the landlord was coming over to fix a door in our room that leads to the fire escape, and that we needed to be out of the way as the landlord didn't know we were renting the room out (contrary to what I was told when I moved in). I was also told I was not allowed to sit in the living room either. 
I became suspicious as the door works perfectly fine and I recorded this fact on my phone pre-emptively. I then took two old phones I had and set them at two different angles in my room, recording both video and audio and left the room for the hour.
I came back, checked the videos- it was a full interaction of the main tenant showing our room to someone, making derogatory comments about us, implying that the room was available right now and then leaving. No landlord at all. I copied over these videos to my hard drive, then went out with my roommate to talk to the main tenant who was in the living room. She told us that she didn't know us very well, her friend needed a room, and so we had to be gone by Sep. 1, and lying to me about who was entering our room was no big deal. I informed her that I would need a written and notarized 30 day notice, which she said she didn't need to give me because I don't have a written lease with her as the main tenant.
However, having dealt with eviction before, I know that a) as of August 4th, I will be fully protected under occupant/tenant rights, and b) that I can file a protest of unlawful eviction with the SF rent board, which I plan to do as soon as she actually gives me a non-verbal notice/August 4th comes, whichever one is first.

Other info:
We paid our rent and security deposit in full, by check, dated, with notes, etc. and said checks have been cashed. 
Texted main tenant asking for reason for eviction, she has not replied.
I am not sure of how CA recording law specifically applies to recording in my own unit/room, as I placed them there under suspicion of someone entering the unit who was not the landlord. I believe that audio is not allowed, but video is- I'd just like confirmation of it.

What other actions should I take to protect myself and my roommate from being evicted and thrown out from our home?",1
"(NYC) Broker threatening legal action over ""broken fee agreement"" but now works with a new company that our agreement does not mention. Do we need to pay?. Hey everyone,

I posted here a few days ago asking about this but deleted it (I know we're not supposed to do that now, my apologies.)

(NYC) We saw an apartment with a broker from a big rental company, signed a fee agreement stating that in the event that we rent an apartment in that building we owe the company the commission fee. We almost signed with them but they would not wait over the weekend for our guarantor paperwork even though we had put down a deposit. We backed out and went to look elsewhere. We found a new broker who showed us a few places we didn't like and then he tried to show us one at the building where tried to apply to before. We got excited, applied, and got the apartment. 

Now the original broker is coming at us for the fee which we thought we were going to have to pay. We did however find out that they do not work with the same company anymore and is asking us to make a check payable to this new real estate company. In the fee agreement, it explicitly states that we are only to make the commission payable to the company that showed us the building. Not to the name of the broker, broker, and certainly not a whole new company. After seeing this we decided to contact a lawyer who believes that that is illegal and we only have to pay if the original company comes after us.

The broker is not contacting me from any company and is instead sending me text messages directly. When I mentioned that we will not be making a check out to the new company they are requesting or them personally, the broker got upset and is now threatening legal action again. Basically saying that we have to pay the new company so they can process it through the old one.

This all sounds extremely fishy and again, nowhere in the one fee agreement that we signed does it say anything about a new company, the broker receiving the fee, or any transfers between companies. The only issue is the original company no longer has that building under it's listings and it looks like the broker took the building over to their new company.

We are contacting the lawayer again today but I was wondering if this all sounds like bluffing because to my untrained legal mind, we would've had to sign something saying that the fee can transfer companies before paying a whole separate entity instead of who it says to pay in our agreement.

Does anyone have any experience in NYC rental/broker laws?

"Solicitation of a Minor. May have been tricked by a minor and their ""Crazy Ex"" into a chargable offense. Please advise.. So. Let it be known right off the bat that I was told by this minor that they were 18 years old on this mobile app called Grindr. Over the course of a few days we are talking, chatting, getting to know each other, the works. For about half a day they block me, but later unblock me saying they had to. Someone ""they had been with"" had caught them on grindr and he had to lay low. Weird, but as they are talking to me again, I assume all is well.

Anyway, as I am speaking to this supposed 18yo, I was also talking to other profiles. We decided to make this fun and invite a third person to this party. One particular profile seemed very interested and wanted to meet up but refused to send a face picture in response to my own picture and a picture of the 18yo. Eventually I tell this Faceless account to shove it after them giving me the run around. I was stupid. I sent Faceless my own face picture, as well as my cell number. I block them on grindr and just agree to meet the 18yo at a hotel they are already at because of a ""friend's party.""

I arrive at the hotel and am told to go somewhere. By this time I receive a Facebook message request. I ignore it. I continue driving around looking for 18yo. Don't find him. Eventually I get fed up and start recording on my phone of my current location, trying to get 18yo to give me better directions. Keep in mind this entire time I am texting 18yo over Facebook messenger, I have also sent the pics and videos of my location through FB messenger.

Then, the 18yo's messages bubble tells me that I can no longer reply to the conversation. I've been blocked. Huh, odd. I go to their FB profile and can still view it. I log into a secondary FB account and navigate to his profile, and that I cannot start a chat with him with this secondary account. The 18yo has not blocked me, but disabled messenger.

I finally look at my message requests, and find that this stranger has messaged me:

""I'm calling [Local Police Force] right now. Reporting you for trying to have sex with a minor.""

Initially confuaed, but with a slow frightening realization, I book it. Haul ass off hotel grounds and take the long way home

This took place an hour and a half ago.

If what this stranger says is true, I could be charged with solicitation of a minor. I repeat again I was not aware that I was talking to a minor. No where in any of our conversations was there a number other than 18.

"(Michigan) Sprint tried to take money out of my account 5 days before they said they were going to twice.. Hello. I have never used reddit before so I'm sorry if I do anything wrong or I am in the wrong place, just let me know.



I am a current customer of Sprint. I set up my account with them on May 14,2017. This would make my billing due date the 14th of each month. I enrolled in the auto-pay to receive a discount on my bill as well, and was told that my bill would be $175.81 a month. 

However, I noticed that this date would not work for me, it didn't coincidence with my pay dates from my employer. So I called to see about having my billing due date changed to make sure that each month I would have the funds in my checking account to accommodate the bill, at which point the person I talked to said ""Sure no problem"", never having mention that by doing this it would cause me to be doubled billed the next month.   

When I looked at my account and found out about being double billed, I called to inquire about the double charges and was told that was policy whenever you request a change in the billing due date. They credited my account $20.00 for my inconvenience, whatever. I was pissed but ok, I accepted that.
 
Today, on July 15th, I received a text message from Sprint saying that they tried two times to retrieve my payment!  What the Hell! Its only the 15th why are they attempting to take the payment now? I didn't have the $231.36 in my account, so I called to tell them that each time they try to collect the payment (that isn't even due for four more days), they caused my account to be charged $25.00 in NSF fees, making it a total of $50.00 worth of NSF fees (so far).
 
I called to have them explain to me why they have done this and to request that they put back the $50.00, because my account is now overdrawn, only to be transferred to 10 different people, and was treated like I was dumb and told that there isn't anything they can do to help me. Two different people said that they would stay on top of this, that it would be back into my account by the end of the day today was told to hang on while they put in the final notes to assure me that it would be resolved, only to be transferred to another person who doesn't know what is going on. At this point I just want my money back, but all I got was ""Take a deep breath"" and ""calm down"" and ""we can not assist you"". What am I supposed to do now? I have bills that come out tomorrow and no money to pay them. 

Were they even allowed to charge me before my bill was due?? Is there anything at all that I can do?",0
"My cleaning lady started bringing her teenage girls to help her clean over the summer, what do?. Almost a year ago I contacted a housekeeping company on Craigslist. I will change names here, let's call the owners of the company Viktor and Svetlana.

Svetlana sent a cleaning lady to my apartment, we will call her Vera. Vera does a fantastic job, we like her a lot. She is very sweet and meek and deferential. She comes every other week or so as needed, we have a tiny apartment, she charges $60 and I add $10 as a tip for a total of $70, I make out a check to Vera directly every time she comes. She cleans the whole 550 sq. ft. apartment including the dishes.

Vera does not speak basically any English at all, so anything I have to say I have to communicate through Svetlana by text message. I have never met Viktor or Svetlana, but I text them to arrange cleaning or if I have some request for Vera. I have the suspicion that Svetlana may be a bit stern or mean to Vera.

This summer Vera started bringing her girls. The girls are out of school and are helping her clean. Usually I am not home when she comes, so I didn't notice at first, but I worked from home one morning and she had brought her daughter, and then another time I noticed that she has two daughters she sometimes brings. The girls are very sweet and always smiling and pleasant. 

I am not certain of the age of the girls, but they are both teenagers. The older one is probably 16-17, the younger may be 14-15.

I don't know what to do.

My concerns:

- We like Vera and her girls a lot. I actually used to clean apartments myself when I was in college full-time and I can't imagine doing it as a single mother. She seems like a great mom with happy girls and we are not judging her or wanting to get her in trouble, I am confident that she is making the best choices she can for her girls. Whatever I do I do not want to make life harder for her or her girls.

- I don't know how old the girls are or if they are being compensated fairly. I can't ask Vera about this because she knows so little English she is nearly mute. I could ask Svetlana, but I don't know how much I trust Svetlana, I have never even met her.

- I have no idea how many hours a week the girls are working, I don't know how many homes Vera cleans. It seems she only brings her girls occasionally and only since the summer began, she brings the older one more often I think.

So I guess my question is, how do I know whether this arrangement is legal? Am I violating child labor laws? How do I remedy this situation in a way that is best for Vera and her girls?",0
"Need Quick Advice Re: A Transient Going to Sentencing this Morning, Please!. For ease, I will describe what I understand to be true as fact. I'm happy to clarify anything that seems unlikely, my information comes from various sources including the subject. 

A transient (T) was falsely arrested a few months ago. She was already on probation for multiple minor charges (i.e. drunk in public), when she was shopping at a local store and had an altercation with an employee. The police were called, they looked for a reason to arrest her, and the store clerk said T spit on her. T is adamant that any spit that may have come out was accidental because she was talking loudly. 

After some time trying to meet probation requirements, T was eventually picked up for missing a court date and has been in jail awaiting trial for months. Her Public Defender was going to take it to trial because the DA wouldn't budge and wanted to throw the book at her, the PD thought that was dumb. For background: T is mentally ill, physically disabled, has cognitive impairments, TBI, has been living on the streets for a decade, in and out of jail for minor offenses and drugs but nothing serious. 

T has court this morning, and I found out late last week that it is for sentencing. I spoke to T (who is not always the most reliable source, but tends to be honest with me), and her PD convinced her to plea no contest, otherwise they were going to give her a year and a half because ""the judge doesn't want a trial."" Her PD also told her she'd seen surveillance video, which does *not* show the store clerk reacting as though she'd been spat on.

I'm concerned T doesn't understand that pleading no contest to something she was falsely arrested for means she won't be able to potentially recover damages from the false arrest (she had been trying really hard at that point and there had been some improvement, and she was *on her way to therapy* when this incident happened). I want to send an email to her PD before the sentencing to express my concerns that T isn't fully mentally competent and that she doesn't understand the implications here. I have about an hour.

Also, I know this kind of plea coercion is common, but I hope I don't sound too naive when I say I don't like it being used on a vulnerable member of the population. She has literally no resources in life, it was all too easy for a retail clerk to get annoyed that her authority wasn't respected and have this person incarcerated for months for it, and the police actively helped. 

Question is: Anything specific I should/shouldn't say in this letter?",0
"Unknown neighbors placed large ""No Trespassing"" sign in my parents' backyard. They certainly had to trespass to place it. (Northern Illinois). First off, I know that placing a ""No Trespassing"" sign directly facing someone's yard (it's visible from our living room windows) is very passive-aggressive and screams that we've had some sort of neighborly feud. However, we have not. We do not even know who owns the land behind our yard and thus placed the sign.

To give a better picture, the wooded area behind our back yard goes on for about two acres. In winter, when there are no leaves, you can barely see a small house at the top of a hill, if you know where to look. From that house, I imagine, our back yard is pretty clear to see (only in winter; in summer, it's impossible to see 10 feet ahead of you). It seems reasonable that a new neighbor moved into that area beyond the woods and walked through to our backyard to post the sign. However, I know that is not the case.

The woods used to belong to a farmer that I worked for in middle school/high school. He was very kind and as he did not use the land for anything, he did not mind if the neighborhood kids played on it. Anyway, we know he sold the wooded land behind our backyard to someone, (he divided his land into much smaller parcels and sold them to people who wanted to build their own homes) but we do not know who bought the woods that touch our land.

I know that this new neighbor trespassed to place the eyesore of a sign because there is an impossibly deep ravine/creek that divides the woods. It is impossible to cross, both because it is wide and the water is deep. I'm not sure where it begins or ends, but there is nowhere to cross near our backyard or our neighbors' backyards. The person had to have driven to our house, walked through our back yard, and posted the sign. Once again, I'm not sure why they picked our house. There are other yards adjacent to the woods, and we never go in the woods (I stopped going into the woods maybe 5 or 6 years ago), but I suppose they think that we do.

I hate to mention this, but the only possibility I can think of is that it is racially motivated. There are only two black families in my small town, and we are one of them. None of my other neighbors touching the woods got signs in their yards.

My questions are as follows:

1) How do I find out who owns the property now? The farmer moved away and I don't have his contact info, so I can't find out that way.
2) If I cannot find this neighbor and ask them to take the sign down, is there anything else we can do legally?

Thank you in advance.",1
"[NC] Girlfriend had her contract ended for hospital stay related to PTSD.. I don't think she has a case but now that's she's of more sound mind she's annoyed she was fired because of a hospital visit related to her PTSD.  Basically she was a contract employee for a company when she had an issue that ended up with her in the hospital.  They held her for 4 days but couldn't find a bed for her in a ward better suited for her so eventually released her to my care.  (Ultimately a mistake because she ended up in the hospital again for worse symptoms for a whole two weeks but I digress).  

I never contacted her work during those 4 days, I honestly didn't even think of it, I was spending those 4 days sitting in a chair in her hospital room. Upon her release I do contact them and let them know what happened, she still wasn't really in the shape to talk to them but since her job was basically ticket assigning and chat moderation she agreed to go back to work right away since it was simple and done from home at that time anyway. They ask for a picture of her release paper work showing the days spent in the hospital and leave it at that.  I let her know she said she'd handle it, sent them a picture and that was the end of it for a few hours.

A few hours later they contact us saying she sent a picture of the wrong thing, I look and curse myself for not double checking her because in her addled state she did send the wrong thing.  She sent the picture of the paperwork that basically just said they set her up with an appointment with her normal doctor to follow up about the issues with her PTSD and the hospital stay.

I grab her normal paperwork and see that since she transferred hospitals at some point they only had the 2 days at the second hospital listed not the first two.  So we head out to the original hospital and get the paperwork showing all the days she spent.

I'm sitting at the gas station outside our house when we get a call from the contracting company and are told that they have ended her contract and she doesn't have a job anymore.

They do kind of have a history of this.  Two or three months prior to this another coworker of hers who was actually employee there for over 4 years had their contract ended the day after it was revealed she was hospitalized for a suicide attempt.

I don't think she has much of a case because I don't think contract employees have much at all in the way of rights.  Also they didn't actually know she had PTSD the only thing that told them was the paperwork she accidentally sent them, she never told them herself at any point.  Either way I said I would ask.",0
"In my divorce, I agreed to pay half the mortgage of a condo in my ex's name until it sells. It's still not on the market 2 years later and I want out.. Sorry in advance for the length. I live in CT, fyi.

Seven years ago my then-wife and I bought a condo. It was put in her name but everything including the down payment was split down the middle. We divorced four years later in July 2015 (without lawyers) and we agreed that I would continue living there since she could move in with her mom rent-free. The divorce decree said I would continue paying half the mortgage until it sold and at that point we'd split the money we made (if any). I wanted to cut my losses and walk away since the condo isn't tied to me at all, but she refused to sign the papers unless I agreed to continue paying half the mortgage until it sold.

She said it'd go on the market as soon as it was show-ready. I gave it a good cleaning and bought some nice decorations and new couches for staging. it looked better than when we bought it. She said then it'd go on the market in the spring because that's when most people look for new homes. That never happened. A year ago we agreed that my new girlfriend could move in and take over paying half the mortgage until it sold. So, at that point my ex wasn't paying anything except property tax. After several months it still wasn't on the market. I told her it needed to be put on the market and sold ASAP so we both could move on with our lives. She said she met with a real estate agent friend and the condo is now worth a hell of a lot less than what we paid for it. She said we'd have to keep paying the mortgage for 3 more years until we sell it to break even.

This is unacceptable. It's been 2 years since the divorce and we've made no progress. I desperately want to move and be done with my ex once and for all, but because of our divorce agreement I feel stuck. Moving and taking on a second mortgage/rent is not a possibility -- I barely make enough to cover my bills as it is.

I'm planning on meeting with a lawyer soon to see what my options are, if I even have any. Before I do that, I'd like to hear what /r/legaladvice has to say. Would it be possible to take her back to court and have the divorce agreement revised? I want nothing more than to walk away from this damn condo and create a new life with my girlfriend.

*tl;dr: I agreed to continue paying have the mortgage of a condo in my ex-wife's name. She is no longer paying her half of the mortgage as that's been taken over by my girlfriend. Ex expects me to continue paying for another 3 years so the condo will break even when it sells.*",1
"Applying for a job as a felon, employers are breaking the law in the job application (Oregon). How to proceed?. I recieved a felony DUI in Oregon last year. I served two months earlier this year and am out. I have a decent job now, however a couple ""dream jobs"" have opened up lately.
Here is where I run into an issue. I do not know what to answer on the ""Have you been convicted of a felony (sometimes it asks for lower level crimes too, misdemeanor, etc) box. Now before you say to tell the truth, Oregon law EXPLICITLY does not allow that question. Oregon law HB 3025 states: This legislation prohibits an employer from requiring an applicant: to disclose on an employment application a criminal conviction; to disclose, prior to an initial interview, a criminal conviction; or if no interview is conducted, to disclose, prior to a conditional offer of employment, a criminal conviction.
Portland (where I live) then takes it a step farther, basically stating that they must offer conditional employment before asking about a conviction. They are not even allowed to ask DURING the interview. They must first offer me a conditional offer of employment (cuz ya know, Oregon). After that, if they learn that I have a felony, they can only rescind if the felony directly applies to the line of work I would be in.
So this leaves me in a weird spot. When filling out job applications, local companies and national companies (even ones with large legal divisions, think Amazon, various national mortgage agencies) ask that question. It is yes, or no, and you cannot proceed without selecting an answer. Do I tell the truth and have a 0% chance at getting the job, or do I lie since they are breaking a law by even asking that question?
It gets even more complicated when looking at tax breaks for hiring felons. They get $2400 for hiring a felon within 1 year of his release date, and are protected by a federal bonding program where they can receive $5,000 fidelity bonds, free of charge, as an incentive to hire job seekers that do not qualify for commercial fidelity bonds. Some applications afterwards have you fill out a WOTC where it asks you questions about foodstamps, government assitance, and being a felon. If we decide that lying is the best course of action, do I then tell the truth on the WOTC part of the application to then not be considered a felon on the part of the application where I am being illegally discriminated against, but be considered a felon on the tax credit part where being a felon works to the companies advantage? 
If anyone has any in depth knowledge of this law, or my best course of action, please advise.",0
"[North Carolina] Latest developments with apartment fire saga. Link to the last thread: https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6e7o4c/north_carolina_my_apartment_complex_burned_down/

Like you guys said in the last thread, our renters insurance eventually came through to help with claims. They hired ServPro to handle moving what was salvageable and cleaning various items (furniture, clothing, books, etc.). We have filed a claim with State Farm for the items that are not salvageable and they reimbursed us a couple weeks ago.

So here is where we are now:

- ServPro returned furniture that was ""cleaned"" that had dirt and soot all over it. It's obvious that no one ever touched it.
- ServPro returned furniture and items that did not belong to us. When we told them about this, they seemed baffled by who it could belong to and took it back.
- ServPro returned almost every piece of furniture damaged (including antiques). This isn't cheap Ikea furniture, this is high quality furniture that survived half a dozen moves across the country with no problems. One of the beds won't even assemble anymore. Parts to the bookcases are missing. Every dresser has at least one handle missing.
- When we called them to let them know about the damage, they sent someone to take pictures of the dressers and take sample handles so they could have one of their people make matching pieces. It's been a month since they took those and haven't returned them. 
- Two months after the fire, they finally delivered the suits and dry cleaning. There are at least two $500 jackets missing that were supposed to be included in the dry cleaning.
- They still haven't delivered other missing items we have told them about, and don't seem to have an explanation of where they are.

We've tried being reasonable with ServPro, letting them know about all of the issues as they come up, but this level of incompetence isn't something that can be reasoned with apparently. I'm at the end of my rope in terms of dealing with them. They don't return phone calls, never have answers, and take weeks to get back to us. We called State Farm to see if we could claim the damaged/missing items, but they told us that was an issue we needed to take up with ServPro.

My questions are:

- What are my rights when dealing with this company? Is there any way to move this process along and make them take this issue seriously?
- If renters insurance will not cover items missing/damaged via ServPro, and ServPro won't even return basic phone calls, who is responsible? They're both saying that the other has to pay for the items, not them.
- It is time to hire a lawyer, and if so, what kind?",1
"Recourse for doctor's prescription mess-up?. Hey, this may be a dumb question and if I'm putting it in the wrong place please let me know. 
I went to a new doctor who started me on a prescription for a new medicine to counter some side effects of another medicine I take. The new stuff actually started to help, a lot. For the first time in a long time it didn't feel like my stomach was trying to eat itself constantly. However, they put a typo on the prescription--they prescribed 15 pills at one dosage, and 15 pills at a second, but the second half had the typo and the pharmacy couldn't fill it. No big deal, they have 15 days to correct it, right? Totally wrong. The pharmacy called them 2-3 times in the first week, and faxed the request over as many times. I spent all of the next week calling, leaving voicemails, and never hearing back. Finally Thursday, the pharmacist got a verbal confirmation it was being sent over that day. I called Thursday and got the same confirmation. Nothing. Then Friday morning I called and told them that it needed to be in ASAP so I could pick up that afternoon, because I only had one pill left. They assured me it would be sent to the pharmacy within the hour. 
Pharmacy again got nothing. I tried repeatedly to get through to them again and when I finally got someone on the phone, was told that it was still waiting for the doctor to sign off on it (the girl from the morning had told me she'd messaged the doctor but either she didn't do that, or the doc just didn't bother) and she'd gone home for the day. It's a controlled substance psych med, so the pharmacist wasn't able to even give the one pill to bridge the gap, even though they had the original prescription with that stupid typo.

So today has been an absolutely awful day of being sick, having stomach pains way worse than they were before I started this miracle medicine, and just generally wanting to curl up and cry. 

I'm already looking for another doctor, and gave them honest reviews on Yelp and Google, but honestly with their other low reviews (I didn't even check first, was referred by a friend who didn't have as bad a time) I don't think they care to make improvements. Is there something that can be done to fine them, or somehow bring to their attention how badly they communicate? At this point I just don't want them to screw anyone else over like they did me. 

Thanks everyone, and have a great night.

TL;DR doctor jerked me and pharmacy around for 2 weeks and messed up on a prescription for a psych med, caused massive frustration and a day and a half of feeling awful. Can anything be done to make sure they don't keep doing this to patients?",0
"Chased by a car. Last year, specifically the night before the first day of my sophomore classes at college me and my friend were headed back to our rooms around 11:30 pm from playing soccer.  While headed back to our rooms had to cross the cross walk. While partially through we noticed a white jeep moving at a high rate of speed towards and showed no sign of decelerating. Midway through we ran through it because the car was to close for our comfort. At the end of the cross walk not on the sidewalk yet the car passed us, at that point my friend threw the water in his bottle in the direction of the car. The car hit its breaks and did a three point turn. Me and my friend decide to gtfo and run towards our dorms. The car preceded to jump the curb and chase us through the park. The car was tailing my friend feet behind him until his slow ass feel. Someone jumped out the car aiming something at my friend. He screamed and pleaded to not shoot. At the point the person yelled ""....... police put your hands up"". Luckily my fast ass was a good 25m away. The officer then put on his light to the car. He saw me and directed me to walk over to him. Guy called for backup and 5 more cops came. I had my phone out the whole time, cop was yelling at us calling us retards saying they were going to get us kick out of school yadada, I asked if I was being detained they refused to answer until the 5th time I asked. Then started mocking me for watching tv shows to much. Mind you I recorded this whole interaction. Cop told my friend to watch out who he hangs with next time. (Me and my friend believe this was racially motivated statement since I'm black and he's white, whatever though)  More yelling and we left. I called my dad who is a cop, he came up the next day talked to the school police chief and showed them the video. Said they 100% support us and said the actions were inappropriate. They rewrote their statement which said my friend through a soda bottle at the car windshield which was false. But said only one cop their was a campus police officer. Me and my dad filled a complaint with the towns police, they did an internal investigation and interview me (my friend was scared to interview) which took them the whole school year, we heard back from them 2 months ago saying they found no wrong doing.  

Anything else we can do from here. Just curious as to what you all think? 

My gpa was severely affected by the event I believe.  Went into that year with a 3.3 gpa, got a 2.3 that semester, but then bounced back the next semester with 3.9 now ~ a 3.14 gpa.

"Building Trustee Threatening Lawsuit. I live in New York (upstate) with my partner.  He got a one year lease for an apartment and I was on it as someone staying there, not as the lessee or sublessee. (kinda stupid, I know, but I'm not letting it happen again lol)
Our landlady died in February, and shortly thereafter a man moved in with his sisters.  The local PD posted on Facebook that sister 1 is a level three sex offender.  She didn't disclose it on any forms and the new landlord had no idea, which I'm pretty sure isn't legal on her part.  All three siblings are addicted to cocaine and heroin, and they constantly brought their dealer into their apartment which was above mine.  I hated it, but it didn't seem like a problem to me because it was quiet and contained.  However, it quickly went downhill, and I've had to call the police on them 7 separate times now - threatening each other with knives, pushing people down the stairs, throwing a TV out of their third story window and onto my neighbor's car, etc - and I repeatedly tried telling the new landlord that the new tenants made it unlivable, but he told me his ""hands are tied.""  The lease did have a clause saying we have the right to peaceably and quietly enjoy the rented property, and my brief chat with an attorney about this led me to believe that because I couldn't live there SAFELY (neighbors banged on my door in the middle of the night, tried opening my windows from the outside, one tried kicking down the door), let alone quietly, we weren't obligated to pay rent until the landlord sorted everything out.  We made numerous attempts to tell the landlord about the situation and he always acted like he couldn't do anything.  We continued living there until we moved out shortly thereafter, and didn't pay rent for the last two months (our lease ends this month.)  
Everything seemed to have blown over when just recently, the building's trustee started calling me and requesting to talk to me about my ""intentions"" without ever calling my SO, who actually signed the lease.  I never answered because I've heard horror stories about her from other tenants, until today when I finally decided to answer and get it over with.  I asked why she didn't call the person who's actually on the lease and she told me to ""mind my own business,"" then called me an ""ignorant child"" when I explained what the attorney had told me.  She then screamed a little bit and told me her attorney will be in contact with me shortly.
Who's in the right?  Where do I go from here?
Tl;dr: crackheads made the apartment unlivable so I didn't pay rent and moved out, now the trustee is threatening legal action for the rent.  How badly did we fuck up?",1
"GA apartment complex filed a claim on unpaid rent on my credit report without contacting me. I'm moving from GA to CA in August, and recently applied for a townhouse with my partner with a rental company in CA. I received a phone call from the rental agency today saying that I had a large balance in collections owed to an apartment complex I formerly lived at from November 1st, 2014 to January 1st, 2016 and that they wouldn't rent to me because of the outstanding balance reported on my credit report.

This came as a surprise to me considering I had not received any form of contact (phone call, email, physical mail) from the complex or the collection agency in the 18 months since my lease ended. I also noticed that the claim is only shown on two of my three credit reports.

A bit of backstory about my history with the complex: the complex filed for an eviction on me due to delinquent payment approximately two months prior to the end of my lease. I went through all the normal channels without contesting the eviction, but the end of my lease came and went without the eviction officially being enforced or myself being physically removed from the premises. I moved out on January 1st, 2016 normally, returned my keys, and the office said they would notify me if anything else was needed. This was the last bit of contact I had with the complex.

According to my credit report, the claim was placed for collection on 3/22/2016, but I signed a new lease on an apartment with new roommates in early May without any issue or notification that this claim was on my credit report. I now realize that the one credit report that didn't reflect this claim was the one that complex inquired when running my credit, so I guess I dodged a bullet on that one, even though I had no knowledge of a bullet being present to dodge.

I just got off the phone with one of the credit agencies showing this claim on its report after filing a dispute, even though I have not documentation to show that I never received contact from them, and I'm going to file a similar dispute with the other credit agency showing the claim on its report.

My question is this: Is my dispute valid if I never received contact from the former complex or collection agency regarding the claim filed against me? I'm completely new to this as it is the first time I've ever had to file a dispute against something on my credit report and am operating fairly blind presently. My partner and I want to rent with both our names on the lease as a way to help improve my credit, but I don't know where to turn to for advice on this matter.

I'm cross-posting this on /r/persoanlfinance as well. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",1
"[CAlifornia] LASIK surgeon has performed 2 surgeries in span of 3 months and wants to perform another surgery. 2 separate second-opinion doctors have said that the first surgery was botched and that further surgeries are too dangerous. Legal action?. Hey guys, I'm kind of freaking out cause it looks like my eyes will never get to be 20/20 and I'm out $4000+ due to my current situation..

This kind of a long drawn out process, so I’ll just put everything in bullet form in chronological order:

•	December 2016: LASIK (using Contura laser) performed by doctor A. Result is ok, no longer have to use glasses, but not even close to 20/20.

•	March 2017: Go in for a check up and doctor A suggests an “enhancement” surgery

•	March 2017: Enhancement performed

•	June 2017: Go in for another check up, vision still not improving, doctor A suggests another enhancement.

•	June 2017: Wary of third surgery in the span of 7 months, I ask doctor A for medical records so I can get a second opinion.

•	June 2017: Get a second opinion for doctor B. He says my cornea has now become too thin for any more surgeries. He says that doctor A over corrected my astigmatism during my first surgery, then tried to correct the over-correction during my enhancements, which did not work. 

•	June 2017: Share with doctor A what doctor B told me and recorded the conversation with his consent. Doctor A said that doctor B doesn’t know how to read the provided medical records because doctor A is using the “Contura” laser which doctor B is not familiar or had training with. **With ultimate confidence, he went on to say that with one more enhancement, my eyes will be 20/20 and will not require any more enhancements for the rest of my life.**

•	July 2017: Get a different second opinion from doctor C. The doctor echoes the opinion of doctor B and further went on to say that my cornea could be unstable at this very moment due to the two procedures. She said that due to my cornea thinness, there cannot be any more work done on my eyes now and for the rest of my life. Off the record, she went on to say that doctor A has a reputation in the community to perform reckless procedures and that the claims that he's making about how other doctors can't read his ""Contura"" laser is all ""bullshit"" because she has part of the Contura training as well.

At this point, I have lost all trust in doctor A and don’t think I’m going to not share any more information that I’ve gathered. I am definitely considering moving forward with legal action. Do I have a case? What do you guys suggest I do? Do you guys have any recommendations for a lawyer that can handle this kind of case in San Diego?

Thank you!",0
"(NY) Do I have a legal obligation to report this person for inappropriate relationships with minors/students?. This happened before states began to outlaw student teacher relationships even if the student was over the age of consent.

Essentially, when I was going through a rough time emotionally, I began receiving a lot of extra attention from a teacher. It started innocently and then progressed to emails, followed my phone calls, then texts, then flirting, some sexting and sending him pictures of me in skimpy negligees. When I graduated high school (he was still my teacher for a summer session) we began to go out on dates. He then came to my college to take control of the department I was majoring in and remained my teacher throughout college (we maintained a relationship during this time). 

Now with all of the new legislation and scandals being unearthed (like the choate one) I'm wondering if I have an obligation to report this to someone (the school, his current employer which still has him around students all the time etc). I don't want to get him in trouble because I do still care about him and as far as I'm aware he didn't break any laws (except possession of child porn when I sent the negligee pics (if they count) but they are long gone from all of my electronic devices (this was before the cloud etc). 

See the thing is, I don't know if what he did was wrong/ illegal. My therapist (when I was 17 and involved with him) told me to cut ties but never reported him. My guidance counselor at school knew because the man in question didn't have a drivers license so I drove him one on one to the practice he had at another school after ours was over and I once told my guidance counselor I may be late because of driving him and she said it was inappropriate but never followed up. I don't like thinking I was groomed or a victim (though he was emotionally abusive once he had me in the relationship). 

I also have proof/know he did this with at least four other students.

So, if it happens in the future and I don't report it am I liable for what happens to any further students he becomes involved with? 

Do I have a legal obligation to report it to the schools he works for?

I need to know if there's anything I need (or should) do from a legal standpoint.

 I don't want to press charges (I can't he did nothing illegal with me) and I don't want to get him in trouble but I also don't want any other students to go through what I did and I what I know others did because of his narcissism (he's diagnosed) and emotional abuse.

Yes, I am in therapy for this and working through it and I know it's messed up that I care for him but I do. I just need to know what my legal obligations are.",0
"Please Help Im tired of my parents. Please let me know of any errors and things that I can improve upon. Sorry in advance.


I can't take this anymore. I want to leave this house and be my own person. I am tired of being threatened to leave by my parents. I do so much for them and they hate me.

I am 20 years old, unemployed, and have no car or drivers license. I was adopted unofficially and have no legal paperwork and have no idea if I even have a SSN or any means to get legal help in my situation. For all my life I have been treated as a glorified slave and nanny. I have pretty much raised all 3 of my younger siblings because my parents always had to work (which I understand) but it's way past the normal help here and there. I watched them as babies and fed and bathed them, I took them to school and all of that since I was 8 or so. For 20 years I have been the backbone of my family.

Although I didn't provide financial help I did do pretty much every thing else even cooking and cleaning after my siblings parents and grandparents. They don't even seem to realize how unhappy I am. I asked my parents for my information so I could get a job and they don't have it, they  flat out refused for 20 years to help me change that. Since  I graduated HS in 2015 they've been telling me to leave the house and to get a job but I simply can't because they all ask for my ID and what not and I don't have it. I hate not having my own identity to prove who I am to future employers. I want a change and I am totally helpless and powerless. I have no control over my life and it's already taken a toll on my mental health. I need an escape badly. 

I've attempted suicide more than 5 times from 13-20 years of age and I always change my mind because these people are not worth my life. Yes they did raise me but it feels like they only did so, so they could keep me as free labor. I'm basically just a tool to them they don't even let me stay over family members houses or go out simply because they want me to watch the kids so THEY can go out or sleep or whatever. It's so maddening and I do it only because I love my siblings they need me and I need them especially the youngest one, she loves me more than our parents or anyone combined and I can't bare to leave her with them. 

 I'm so conflicted because they do this to me but on the other hand when we go out together and do family things I feel loved. But the good is only about 10% while the other 90% makes it not worth it in the long run.

Please if anyone knows what I can do to get myself as far away from here as possible, let me know. I'm going to die if I keep living like this. I will gladly give any information I can if you need it. Just please I need advice asap.",0
"Lawyer is MIA, debt collectors are calling. I apologize in advance for totally butchering this but I really don't know the lingo.

February 2016 I was in a car accident (we were rear-ended). I opted to get checked out when EMS came by, they drove me to a nearby hospital, no big deal just some prescribed painkillers for the neck/back pain and headache.  Turns out the car that hit us was a professional driving service, currently on the job driving a couple to some event. It also turned out that the father of the driver of the car I was in was a lawyer. He drove to meet us at the hospital.

He offers to represent us and sue the company. I say that sounds alright, so I signed something saying he would be representing me in that civil suit, and he would only charge a percent of whatever the outcome is. He starts badgering me over the next 2-3 months or so to get physical therapy and send him the bills. I know he's just looking to blow up the damages he's seeking in the suit, but I'm feeling okay enough and I really didn't have insurance or the money to drop on the therapy when I didn't know what would happen with the suit.

So debt collecting agencies start calling me from both the EMS that drove me to the hospital and the hospital charging me for the check up. This goes on for a few months before I say ""I have a lawyer working on this case seeking damages from the company that rear-ended us"" and they just ask for his info and that's it. Haven't heard from the agencies since January 2017.

So back to my lawyer, he's totally MIA. I have not heard a word from him about the case. Is it normal for this to take almost a year and a half? I signed a contract with the guy, but I don't have a copy. Is there any way I can demand something out of this? I really need some updates especially since I don't know what's up with the debt collectors and when they'll be back. Also, is it possible that it's just too late now to pursue a civil suit? The accident was in February 2016.

For more context, the accident happened in the Bethesda, Maryland area. I'm a college student in DC, but my permanent residence is in Florida. I gave the hospital and EMS my DC address, so that's where I've been receiving the letters from them but I'm moving next month. Also, I haven't checked my credit reports, but I use CapitalOne's CreditWise credit tracker and the debts haven't been reported, is this normal too?

TL;DR I signed a contract with a lawyer to pursue a case against a professional driving services company for rear-ending me. I haven't heard from the lawyer in months. Debt collectors hounded me until I told them I had a lawyer working on pursuing damages from the company. I want this case to move forward. What should I do?",0

The next day her and that guy came over and we're sitting in their car in front of my driveway until I came out and trying to harass me to give me my cat to her. Now this was a feral cat that was never owned by anybody except I always paid Veterinary bills and for all other living Essentials and also has lived at my house it's whole life. Well recently she decided I have committed domestic violence against her in that argument and that she wants the cat now, even though she has no proof it's her cat. In doing that I had a court order to return the cat and there was a court date in two weeks from now. She is trying to take my cat right now and the other day while I was at work 2 police officers and my ex showed up to get the cat but the cat was outside and I was at work so they had to come back in the next days. I have visual, text, and Witnesses that show she had made a false statement. Also after I was served a temporary restraining order until the next court date where I can provide everything she kept trying to provoke and contact me calling from different numbers until one time I answered and she said right away "" I'm sorry that was the only thing I could say or do to try and get that cat"" I told her to text it to me but of course she knew what she was doing and wouldn't. She has been talking before she moved out about moving out of state and this guy that she met is from one state away but when she told me he was only a friend at the time she said he's moving back to that state soon. I fear for the life and well-being of my cat or that she will send it off.

 What happens if I don't give up the cat until the court date so that I can provide my evidence that it is both my cat and she made a false statement?

How is she able to say that another animal is hers with no evidence and be granted the ability to steal someone's property?

"Do I have to accept a child support check covered in literal shit or otherwise if it is made elaborately hard to get?. My ex-husband was ordered 3 years ago during our divorce to pay child support. Before I get a bunch of hate PMs -- I work, I didn't ask to keep the kid more. He didn't want more time. I don't enjoy never having any time to myself and always having to do everything on my own. It sucks, ok. I would gladly pay him the $350 he is required to pay me a month to get any sort of break on healthcare, child care, or even not having to use every single vacation day of work for a sick day or because school is out. Do you know how great it would be to just have to pay $350 a month for all child related expenses. It would all be worth $350 because that is nothing compared to the cost of a kid. I spent $100 on shoes the other day. Shoes. He needed shoes for school and water shoes for water activities and nice required shoes   
for graduation. I swear to god I just bought him shoes 3 months ago that don't fit now. So before you come at me with the collecting child support shame just think for a second about how much it costs you to live and double that. Double all your costs. It isn't easy on one income. It isn't easy on two incomes. 

My problem is my super pissed ex-husband who sees him kids the last weekend of every month likes to make it uncomfortable or hard to get my child support. In the last year, he has stuck the check in an actually bucket of slop, he has stuck it in a zip lock baggie of dog shit, he has taped it to my roof, he has tried to get me to play an elaborate scavenger hunt, he has driven to my son's elementary school on a day that isn't his custody day and stuck in my son's backpack and not told anyone and when I asked him where it was he has said "" guess where?"" which lead to an elaborate search of the house and two days of a guessing game (it was well hidden in a tiny pocket in the backpack and my son had no idea his dad even put anything in there, he has buried it in my back yard with my son's help, he has hand delivered to my HR department at work with ""for the bitch"" on the envelope, paid me cash in all $1, he has threatened to pay me in change (which he has not done yet), and he has written me 350 different checks for $1 each. 

It is always something and it is getting old. I have not accept checks before (the ones covered in things) and he has eventually written me new ones after giving him a hard time. 

I am exhausted. This is annoying. He doesn't work a consistent job so often times a garnishment would be hard. He always pays on time without hesitation but this is insane. 

How much of this do I have to put up with? Is this just something I have to deal with for the next 11 years?",0
"Stepfather won't leave. So this is a throw away account since I'll be giving away a bit about my location here. I've trying to find a solid awnser to this for the last 2 months and have been getting nowhere.

 I'm asking on behalf of a friend (for simplicity let's call him Horsie since its what my niece calls him) and this situation is a bit messed up. Horsie is pretty much family in every sense but legal, he's my nieces godfather and absolutely adores her, he takes her camping every few months, took her with him to Oshkosh the first year after he got his pilots license, bought her a rifle for Christmas with my sisters consent and once a week would take her out to his mother's property to teach her proper gun safety and how to shoot. Since my sister is on disability he's surprised her occasionally by paying part of her bills without being asked. He's never once asked for anything in return except spending time with her his dad adores her and his mother loved her. For very convoluted (and extremely messed up reasons involving the fact that my sisters dad is a delusional, an idiot, and a dick) my sister is currently homeless as her choices were live in a house that was held together more by mold than nails or spending a few days with a another friend before moving in with Horsie once he got moved to his mother's place, he intends to give her the in-law house on the property.


Horsie's mother passed away about 6 months ago do to a stroke. In addition to a massive emotional hole she left a will that arranged for her life insurance (about $70,000) to go to his step father but she willed all her physical property to her son (Horsie). The problem is that Horsie's mom and stepdad have been living in this house for the last 15 years. He was asked politely to move out about 4 months ago and said he would, about 2 months ago Horsie asked him when he'd be moving out and stepdad said he couldn't afford it. Frustrated Horsie offered to pay his moving expenses, stepdad said he would look for a place. Still not hearing anything Horsie checked in last month and was informed that he couldn't find a place he liked and had decided not to move. He's run out of patience and is trying to find a way to get him to leave. As the lease for his apartment is up at the end of the month.

So for important info: this is in Columbus, Ohio, the property was in her name only however Horsie's stepdad is trying to claim right of surviorship. Does he have any way to get his step dad out of the house without burning through money? The step dad was a problem long before his mom passed to such a degree that to avoid fights he only visited his mom when he wasn't home and in the three days she spent in comma after her stroke his step dad never visited.",1
"My landlady tried to kill me and accused me of assault. My landlady told me I had 2 hours to move out with no prior notice. When I refused, she grabbed my head and tried to drag me out of the house and told her husband she was going to kill me. I bit her arm in self defence and she beat my head with the tv remote that was in her hand at the time then dropped the remote on my floor. I called the police as I feared for my life and when she heard me calling the cops she too called them. When the cops arrived she said that I initiated the attack by going for her arm with my teeth and she was grabbing my hair to get me off. The cops said the mark isn't in a self defence position for a headlock and helped her evict me that night. When I wrote to her asking for my deposit back a few days later she then made allegations of assault against me to the police and I had to go for a voluntary interview at the police station. After hearing my version of events the police decided to take no further action and told me that next time I should insist on signing a tenancy agreement (I was a lodger and had none). When I received no reply to my letter for my deposit back I then wrote a formal letter before action. She responded by saying that I couldn't have my deposit and outstanding rent returned because I hadn't given a months notice and I assaulted her (even though I couldn't give notice because she kicked me out with less than a days notice and she assaulted me first) and demanded £1000 for damages (time taken off work for blood tests etc). I went to the citizens advice bureau and they said that I am owed my deposit back and she has no case as the police has decided to take no further action but I'd like a second opinion from the good people of Reddit pls...

My landlady has told me in the past of how she used to get into fights in school and came home from her honeymoon with a black eye because she got into a fight in a nightclub. She used to be a size 20 but lost about 10 stone just before her wedding but she is still a large lady. Her husband is also very large. On the other hand, I am a small skinny Asian with no spine who would rather cry in my room than attack somebody. Her words to the police were something along the lines of ""she latched onto my arm with her teeth and bit down"" which sounds pretty far fetched imo. I just think you've got to be a special type of crazy to attack somebody twice your size by biting them while their husband is downstairs...

Is there any chance at all that she could get money out of me for ""damages"" or wages lost? We both drew blood so I count us even and I don't want to take her to court or anything either. I don't want her money, I just want my deposit back and then move on and forget her.",1
"Me [28/F] with my bosses [70/75 F] Don't believe I am sick, and I'm faking complex sickness to leave work for ""appointments"". I work for a well-known company in Canada (Ontario), I’ve been with them for roughly 4 years. Now I was originally hired out of nepotism, as my boss and bosses boss are both related to my Fiance and family friends.

First year or so I was good, everyone was impressed with my work, took no sick days, gave no trouble. Towards the end of the second year I have started having medical issues, mainly migraines. At first they were sympathetic towards me, but after a while they started to think I was lying.
I went from maybe 1-2 specialists before this job, to almost 10. I was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor causing my migraines, Endometriosis, Lichen Sclerosis, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and they are still looking for other diseases I’m exhibiting on top of all the stupid BS I’ve gone through in my life. Its fucking exhausting.

I started with just an agreement with therapy every Thursday morning, I would come in a little late so I could go to a session and gradually decrease frequency. Eventually I got referred to more specialists in the larger town I work in, and tried booking them before work as I work odd hours. Normally this works out well, but the odd time I need to go get a scheduled ultrasound, or specific blood work done that takes an hour or so. Although I try my best to work around my work schedule, sometimes it ends up overlapping a bit, or an appointment runs a little late because of hospital emergencies. Normally I call and let them know what’s going on and how late I might be.

As of late though I’ve been getting a lot of comments like “I heard your appointment went late” and “oh what kind of doctor is that?”, “I didn’t know they scheduled MRI’s for that late”, and my personal favorite “From now on we need all your appointments in writing”(I email all appointments work interfering or not) I know neither my boss or bosses boss believe me. I come in after an appointment with disapproving looks, and snide comments. I’m starting to get nervous and anxious every time I have an appointment now. I’ve shown them the paperwork that confirms everything I’ve told them, but they just think I’m still making all this shit up.

Has anyone dealt with this type of situation before? Is there anything I can do going forward? I have a 2 month span with roughly 9 appointments….. I’m just so tired of everything. My Fiance supports the idea of leaving and I’m looking, but I can’t leave out right due to financial reasons. There’s no reasoning with either of my bosses either.

"[UK] Threatened by an ex-'boyfriend' who has naked photos of me.. When I was 16, I thought I was in an online 'relationship' with a 35 year old. I was in a bad place - I was lonely and sheltered. And he gave me lots of attention. I gave him naked pictures and videos to satisfy him. This went on for 3 years (met him online at 15, broke up at 18). 

When we broke up, he texted me to tell me he'd released all my photos/videos. I told him I'm calling the police. He got cold feet and said he was only angry, and had done nothing. He revealed he had kids and would focus on them and leave me alone. Of course, he didn't stick to this - he continued to fuck with me, telling me I'd ruined his life etc. He was prone to obsessive anger. I became afraid, as I was just beginning my life. 

I changed my name, my number and deleted all online profiles. I'm in my twenties now. I slowly came out of that shell and made a LinkedIn and Facebook. I forgot about him.

He found me again. I know it's him. He has the same patterns in typing and habit.

I got a text from a stranger (again in the middle of the night, asking me how I was. They gave a bogus name. So I said I was a Tom from another town. He apologised and left me alone.

The next night, he messages asking 'how wasn't your graduation tom?'. Which is too coincidental. I ask who it is - he replies that he knows who I really am, and tells me my actual name. He says I'm doing his head in, and God help me when he sees me. And that we will meet soon.

He doesn't respond to other messages. 

Now I'm scared. I want to go to the police, but I'm afraid to set him off. He's been following me for 5 years. And I have little evidence of his grooming as I had to delete it all.

All I have are the threatening messages. And a picture of his face and dick. I don't have the pictures I sent him.

This guy has worked in law and he terrifies me. He has it in for me. I changed my name once, and went into hiding. I don't want to live in fear again. I just made something of myself...I'm just beginning my career. And I have these naked pictures hanging on a thread..

Can you please advise on what I ought to do?

**TLDR: I was groomed online at age 16-18 years old, by a man in his 30s. I do not have evidence of this, due to very intrusive parents and a will to move on. I changed my name and moved to a different city.
The man was very obsessive, and has stalked me for 5 years, without my knowing. I know this as a stranger has made contact, displaying very similar patterns to the groomer. He is also very angry, and has threatened to hurt me. I am incredibly scared. I don't know what to do, as he has a huge stash of my naked pictures and videos. I am afraid he may release them if I trigger him. Please help**",0
"Landlord failed to have the apartment ready on the agreed upon date (Houston, TX). This is happening in Houston, Texas.

I signed a lease stating that I was to move in to the apartment on July 8th (I signed about three weeks before this date) and would receive a copy of the lease on the move in date. Relying on that agreement, I arrived July 8th and gave the leasing agent the cashier's check for $735.48 and received the keys to the apartment so that I could begin to move my belongings into the apartment. I did not get a copy of the lease, the reason they said was because the manager was not there to sign it. I had recruited the help of several friends to help me move the larger furniture. When I went to the apartment there were several issues:

The newly installed shower was not finished. 
Neither of the two smoke detectors were functional. 
There was a large crack in the sliding glass window. 
The carpets had not been cleaned in any way. 
There was a severe infestation with pests in the kitchen.
After speaking with the leasing agent I was told that the carpets should have been cleaned, shower finished, and apartment sprayed for pests. They informed me that they would call the cleaning company to clean the apartment that night (July 8th) and that I would have to wait to move in the next day (July 9th) so that the carpets could dry. The assistant manager offered a concession equivalent to the prorated rent for July 8th and 9th and informed me the manager was not going to be in until Monday (July 10th). 

On July 9th I returned to move in and I found the apartment in the same condition, it had not been cleaned and none of the issues had been addressed.

The morning of July 10th I returned to the apartment complex at 9:00am to speak to the manager, meaning I had to go into work late to be able to talk to her. She told me that the apartment would be cleaned that day and I could move in later that day. The people I had recruited to help me were not able to help me move July 10th, I had a work obligation today (July 11th) and will be out of town the remainder of the week until the morning of July 17th, making that the earliest possible date I could move in (if I am able to get help from friends).

The manager offered concession of rent from July 8th until the date I move in but said they would not pay for movers despite the fact that I had help lined up to move the weekend we had agreed I would be moving in and now have no help to move. Are they legally obligated to cover moving costs for me due to me having to hire movers because they were the ones to breach the contract? The relevant section of the Texas Property Code I believe is Title 8, Chapter 91, Sec. 91.004.

What if anything am I entitled to?

"My past roommate is threatening to take me to small claims court. So, me and my other roommate used to live with this girl that had to leave the state and decided to sublet her room in our house. She never moved her stuff out of the house and forced the subletter to live amongst her things.

The result of that was that the old roommate kept the majority of her possessions scattered throughout the house. Me and the other roommate just accepted it and agreed she could do so until her lease was up. 

So, her lease ended in July and she never came to collect her things. A totally new person signed the lease to her room and we had to fill our house with even more of her junk, her bed, etc to move the new person in.

She texted me and the other roommate that she would be by July 13th to pick her things up, but also demanded that we pay her money to buy her out of the things she contributed to which amounts to roughly 200 dollars. She said, or else she would take those items out of the house. I told her back in text ""I'm ok with you taking the things you paid for"" meaning not the items we co-owned together.

She also demanded that since after she moved out that we never took this couch cover and this rug off the ground for her that we both have to pay her the total brand new cost of those items which amounts to 90 dollars total.

She started harassing me and the old roommate with venmo for those items. I actually paid her some money, but my roommate is vexed at this situation especially because we had to live amongst her shit for almost a year, and hasn't given her any money.

Anyway, this morning she emailed us threatening to take us to small claims court and saying she had legal representation. She's taking me to court for the carpet and couch cover I never touched, and my other roommate for everything else.

I talked to her on the phone and told her that she should be grateful we took such good care of her things and didn't ask for a storage fee, but she said she didn't need to be grateful because her subletter agreed to live amongst her possessions. 

However, me and the other roommate on the lease never agreed to store her possessions, we are just nice people and didn't want drama. Now her lease is actually up, I reminded her she is not on the lease any longer, and she really needs to take her things, but she had some backwards logic about still being entitled to have access to the house

My roommates and I changed the locks because we are truly frightened that this person will retaliate in some way. I'm just wondering if she can really take me to small claims court for this petty tit for tat BS, I'm also wondering if I'm allowed to just put her stuff outside at this point.

Anyway, I appreciate any advice. I live in California.",1
"(Beltsville-MD) Landlord not replacing broken fridge, and claims of unpaid rent.. Hey guys, 

My girlfriend is currently renting an apartment with her friend and their refrigerator has stopped working properly. The freezer is broken and neither of the fridge or freezer is working properly. E.g. freezer is leaking and the fridge is warmer than normal. 

Now, this is the first I have heard of it and am trying to get her to scan me her rental agreement, but she is positive they cover the appliances. According to her, and with information to back this up:

* She has talked and emailed her landlord approximately 5 times now over the course of at least 30 days and he keeps saying its on order or that they need measurements again to order the unit. This has gone on several times.

* Since this has happened her power bill has doubled, obviously from the unit working 24/7 because it cannot satisfy the temperature and they have actually decreased the time that they use their AC to almost half. Yet the bill still went from $80 to ~$170.

Another issue they have received is a letter attached to their door stating that:

&gt;  ""Please note that we have sent your lease to our attorney to file suit with the district court of Maryland for non-payment of rent and requested possession of your apartment home.""

Again, according to her:

* They have documentation of payment in the form of a receipt and the signature of the person that they have always paid. Which he has stated numerous times that they pay around a week early. Now, this she has stated, is not the normal way they receive a receipt, but both checks are photocopied front and back with a signature of their lease manager (I assume this is his title, as he is the one that directly handles the money and tenant problems but he is not the landlord). The amount on the paper is also not the amount that they pay in rent per month. We assume a mistake in their billing dept. Also, this letter was not signed.

Steps I have told her to take:

1. Send a certified letter of previous interactions of the request of the replacement/fixing of the fridge.
2. Set up a meeting as soon as possible to clear up the rent payment mistake. Wonder if it is the fact that the receipt was improperly recorded.

Other than that my big questions are, because I am not from MD and neither is she, what type of recourse do we have for the:

* Electric bill compensation
* Fridge being basically defunct for a month
* Possibility of them not accepting the receipt

Thanks for any help. I'll be heading over there Friday regardless to get with management to shed some light on this for me and their side of the situation. But I am hoping to gain some knowledge to not make an ass of myself by talking about things I haven't a clue about.",1
"[NJ] Purchasing a house and was just told of 4 undisclosed unpaid mortgages on property when the closing is this Friday. What can be done?. We are purchasing a house in NJ and have already gone through the process of getting approved for the mortgage and set up a closing date for this Friday, July 14th. House has been appraised for slightly more than what we are purchasing and we are in a contract with the seller since a few months ago. 

More background information:
The house has been appraised that satisfies the bank, the repairs have been done that we and seller both agreed upon, our title company requested for a closing date to be set for this Friday, everything had been done according to what information we received before. However, the seller's title company and broker just did a title search on the house, last Thursday, and it came up that they have 4 mortgages on the house (one that is over 500K, even though the house is worth half of that), and is now in foreclosure status so we cannot move forward with the closing. According to the seller's agent the seller told them that all of the mortgages had been paid off, but the seller never provided the proof of that except for one of the four mortgages to the seller's agent. 

Now we have already put thousands of dollars into this ordeal; 2,000 for the deposit, ~1,200 for the appraisal and inspections, among another few thousand for various other fees for the purchase. 

We have emails from the title company and the seller's agent stating that we cannot move forward with the closing because of the unpaid loans on the house. Our agent told us that they already did a title search back in May and it came back clear, but now its not according to the seller's company. Our real estate agent and our loan coordinator have never come across a situation like this before ever as they told us. Which makes sense since the lender would not have moved forward with the loan process in the beginning if this was the issue. Both our agent and loan coordinator have told us that we can sue the seller and the seller's agent since this is in breach of the contract we signed in the beginning. 

We are just baffled at the fact that this is all coming out a few days prior to closing and we are in a tight spot since we were supposed to move in next month. In addition, our current lease is up as well since we planned for moving into the new house. 

We have already contacted a few lawyers and are waiting to hear back from them. 

How do you guys see this situation? Is there anything we can do from a legal standpoint at all? What would you guys recommend? 

Thanks guys any and all advice is appreciated greatly. If theres anything that I missed above about the issue please ask away. We are in dire need of help with this.",1
"My girlfriend's brother hit somebody for making lewd comments about my girlfriend, who is under 18. He's facing charges. What does he do? (Colorado). I realize that this is probably a lost cause, but whatever.

For context, my girlfriends brother, called Eric for this story, works in a family-owned restaurant in a mountain town in Colorado. My GF, called Jane for this story, was going to the town to meet up with her brother, as they hardly ever see each other. He is 27, Jane is 17. Eric has been working in a restaurant to finance his wedding to his fiancé, Jordan (fake name). He also works in ski patrol during the winter and does odd jobs around the town during the summer.

The incident began when Jane arrived in town. Jane and Jordan were waiting outside the restaurant for Eric to get off his shift, and both of them go inside to ask Eric how long he has remaining in his shift before he's off. Jane goes to wait outside while Jordan talks to the manager. Jordan comes back outside, apparently looking really creeped out and distraught. Jane asks what happened, Jordan says the manager asked how old Jane was, saying ""what is she? 19? 20?"" Jordan relies and says, ""no, she's 17, why?""

The manager responds with ""well when she's wearing shorts like that she might as well be 20. She's got an ass like a 20 year old"" and then made a gesture where he made a circle with his thumb and index finger, and inserted his other index finger into the hole repeatedly. (This is obviously a sex gesture).

It should be noted here that the manager of the restaurant is not the owner, and is a 42 year old man. 

Jane and Jordan wait for Eric to get off work, and when he does, they tell him of the situation. Eric replies with ""I'm going to fucking beat his ass."" (Eric is very protective of Jane. For the first 6 months of our relationship, our dates were always me and Jane… and Eric. Were like brother now though.) 

Jane and Jordan tried to hold him back from going into the restaurant, but they're small girls while Eric is 6'4"" 250 lbs of pure muscle. He walked back into the restaurant, and Jane and Jordan followed him. He asked the manager what he said about his sister, and he, strangely, told Eric exactly what he said, with gesture and all, and added at the end ""she's a dirty little girl, isn't she Eric?"" And winked after the last question.

Eric uppercutted the manager so hard he left the floor briefly before hitting the ground. The manger was driven to the hospital by Eric, and has a concussion, a broken cheekbone, and brief amnesia.

I should say now that this is all 2nd hand. I didn't witness any of this, but Jane and Jordan saw all of it and relayed it to me.

Is there anything they can do to keep Eric out of jail and not bankrupt him/the entire family? Thanks all!",0
"My landlord wants to increase my rent by 30%. There is no lease.. FYI, the landlord is my mother. In September, I agreed to rent one of her properties for $800 per month. No lease was ever presented to me, so there is no signed agreement.

Over the next several months, my mother (a full-blown narcissist) eventually estranges everyone she knows, including my dad, all three of her children, and all three of their spouses, by saying some truly horrible things that she cannot take back (one small example: in a group text, she told everyone in our family that my wife was only with me for the money, and was not stupid enough to ever have children with me, and that she would eventually leave me) (my wife was not amused). She has recently initiated a divorce against my father (amazing man, btw, my top role model in life).

Now, she has sent me a text message saying she wants to increase my rent from $800 to $1050 (31.25%). I have not responded. Actually, we haven't spoken in two or three months.

------------------------

I can easily afford this rent increase, and I do think the proposed rate is fair for the unit. However, I am not feeling particularly inclined to cooperate right now, given she's been fairly horrible to everyone in the family, myself and my wife included.

So, here is my plan. And please let me know if you can see any problems with it.

1) I am going to ignore her request to increase rent. It was sent via text message, is counter to our existing agreement, there is no lease, and to the best of her knowledge I have blocked her texts and calls anyway. I will actually continue to avoid contact entirely.

2) I will continue to mail her rent checks for $800 on a monthly basis. The payment history is already very well established, as I have always paid with checks, which she has been depositing.

3) My wife and I want to move out, quickly. We are currently looking at houses, and are planning on buying within 2-4 months, and already have a number of candidates that fit what we are looking for and are in our price range.

4) We plan on giving my mother 30 days written notice that we are moving out. Once we are out, the unit will be open for either a) renting out to a new tenant, or b) my father moving in. Personally, I'm a very big fan of Option B.

As there is no lease, I feel like I am fairly well protected. I do like to plan for the worst case scenario though, which would entail my mother continuing to go nuclear against her family and possibly trying to evict my wife and I. Chances of that happening are only about 15%, I think, as long as I do not poke the bear by opening my mouth and talking to her. But I think that if she did decide to do that, we would be moved into our new home by the time anything could ever come of it anyway.

"Dishwasher starts an electrical fire (caught early) - has a fire hazard recall.. I've run into a bit of an issue with my dishwasher and I would be interested in getting your opinions on how to resolve it.

The other night, I started my dishwasher before bed. I later woke up to thick, black smoke, the smell of burning electronics and noise coming from my dishwasher. I sprinted over to it and turned it off. The smoke and burning seemed to be coming from the top, control area of the dishwasher and it continued for a while after removing power from the unit.

After doing a little research online regarding dishwashers and electrical fires. I kept seeing images of my exact dishwasher associated with many of the issues. Many of the pictures showing fire damage were in the exact location that affected my unit. I found out that Bosch had placed a recall on my model. I've entered my model and serial number on their site and it has confirmed my unit is affected by the recall. I also called customer support and they too confirmed the recall of my unit.

After calling Bosch's customer support I have two options: 
-Allow them to have someone repair my dishwasher 
-40% off a new Bosch replacement.

I have to admit, I am not very interested in simply having my defective model repaired. Had I not woke up, my house very well could have burned down while my wife, two-year-old daughter, seven-month-old son, our dog, cat and I were sleeping. I'm not sure about repairing it and having a ticking time bomb of a fire hazard in the house. If the unit is repaired but breaks down afterward due to damage that was done to the unit when it started burning but was not caught and fixed by the repair person during the original visit. Then we would not be covered for an additional repair?

The 40% off a new Bosch dishwasher seems like the way to go. However, there are some drawbacks with their fine print. You have to order the replacement off of their website. Their website has an option to add to cart or online retailers. The 40% discount documentation states that I have to order through them on their site. If I purchase from Bosch directly, I am paying full MSRP on the replacement unit plus: an additional $50 for shipping, have to install the new unit and pay to have my old unit disposed of. This would end up costing $200 more than what these dishwashers are selling for in retail. That is nearly equivalent to subtracting 25% of the 40% discount and having to wait an additional 2-3 weeks for the forms to be submitted, claim to be processed, shipping and install the new unit.

What are your thoughts? How might you go about handling this? 

A 40% discount would have seemed to be a fair, good faith resolution if it wasn't for the inflated pricing and all of the associated inconveniences.",0
"Wells Fargo is suing me, please help. Please no judgement here, I really don't know what to do and I need some solid advice.

Before I start I want to say I realize this whole situation is mostly my fault and I am not skirting blame, I just need an idea of what to do next.

Okay, I'm 26 I have had a wellsfargo savings account since I was 14.  When I was in high school hey started pressuring me to get a checking account and a debit card and I didn't want to but they harassed me for six months until I got one.  They then told me my info was going to get stolen online so I had to get an ""online debit card"" (I was 18 at the time and I grew up poor so I didn't know this was not a good idea) hey also said that if I had this ""online debit card"" then I won't get charged for having a checking account (something they were charging me for unknown to me and unknown to me they were charging me monthly for the online card as well.

Flash forward a couple years and they start offering me a credit card, I turned it down multiple times but they had me go back and talk to a banker and he started trying to scare me into getting one saying things like ""what if you have an emergency? What if you get stranded? Etc"" and finally I have in because they said it was the lowest interest you could get because it was a student credit card but they still gave me a huge interest rate and I didn't realize because it was my first one and my family never had credit cards.  A couple years later I go in to get a very small car loan - $1,000 to cover the gap and they won't give me an auto loan and he only thing they will offer is a $7,000 limit line of credit that I did not want but it was either take it or don't have a car.  The guy told me one interest rate when I signed and when I looked at the paperwork later it was a different number but I had already signed.

Everything was going well until jobs started cutting everyone to part time in the last couple years, my job did it and even with two jobs I couldn't financially stay afloat while going to a University ($11,000 per year) so I started sinking into debt.

It got to a point recently where I had to decide if I wanted to pay my rent or my credit cards because I am struggling really badly so I stopped paying my credit cards.

It's been a few months and now wellsfargo is suing me for $7,000 and their attorney fees.  

I don't have money to pay them unless I do $50 over 5 years with no interest, otherwise I have to declare bankruptcy because if they garnish my wages I won't be able to eat...

I don't know why to do guys, I'm so stressed and I recognize that my ignorance of finances got me here but I really need help getting back out.  Any advice or help you can offer would help me so much.  Thank you all, I didn't know where else to turn.",0
"Divorce, Child Support, and Crazy People. So I have this friend who is currently trying to undergo a divorce. He wanted to start now, but he has to have 1k up front. So it will be about two ish weeks. Well, assuming child support doesn't stack up against him. 

Anyway, his soon to be ex is a sucky person. She is overdramatic and always tries to start problems. Throughout their thirteen year marriage, she would walk out or kick him out and always do something dramatic to try and get him to chase after her like they do in all the romcoms. 

This last time was it for him. She slapped him in the face and he shoved her back and held her against the wall, telling her to never touch him again. He didn't slap her or hurt her in any way. He restrained her. So what does she do? Goes out and gets a restraining order against him and feigns ""domestic violence"" and deems him unsafe. She realized that was pushing it over the limit because not even hours after filing it, she tried dropping it. 

Whether it was through text or messenger, she would spam message him appologies and threats intermittently, which I know is grounds for her not being able to get a restraining order later on. Well, ""protective order"" I think.

He is done with that nonsense. And this woman finally realized how good she had it before. She has a job, but it doesn't pay well. And pretty much the moment after she did this and they began the ""separation"" phase, she was demanding money. She wanted like, 1500 bucks per month in child support. (We used a chart and consulted a lawyer for the actual cost he should pay.) She dropped the order the following week as soon as she could and has been repeatedly begging and threatening him throughout the last three weeks now. 

She is also wanting him to pay rent even though he doesn't live there, or she will take the kids away. 

He doesn't have a problem helping his kids, but we know if he keeps helping her she is just going to make it worse for him. And she said that if they do a divorce, she will make it harder on him than necessary because she is vindictive. She wants to do a legal separation so that she can still have power over him.

We have logs of all the messenger conversations and texts between them as written record and he avoids speaking in person as long as possible. He is paying child support and is picking up his kids a couple times a week. 

But he tries to keep minimal contact with her, even when she continues threatening him and saying questionable or incriminating things.

Should he continue speaking sparingly? Does he need to go ahead and pay all their bills? And what should be his course of action throughout this ordeal? Sorry if I'm missing details, I'm typing this on my phone while waiting on a game of Black Ops to queue up. I will add more later.",0
"[Florida] How can I adopt my step-son? How can my husband and I get custody of my other step-son that lives with their mom?. Trying to make this short and sweet. My husband has two sons from a previous relationship (not marriage). The older one lives with us and the younger one lives with their mom. This was her choice. Before my husband and I got together she decided she no longer wanted the older boy to live with her, she gave no reason why. My husband told her that he wanted both but she would only give him the older boy.

She makes no effort to visit with the older boy. She'll call him and tell him how much she loves and misses him and promise that he can come spend the night at her house soon, which never happens. She just gets his hopes up then crushes him. I really want to adopt him, but I don't know how to do that. If his mom has to sign some sort of document, it won't happen. She cares about her image too much. She's always posting pictures of him on facebook (pictures that my husband and I take, she takes them from our profile) and saying how much she loves him. She just does it so her facebook friends will praise her on what a good mom she is. I really don't think she cares about him at all. 

My husband and I regularly pick up the younger boy and he stays at our house for a few days. Whenever we go to pick up the younger boy, the mom gives the older boy a quick hug and maybe a cheap toy that breaks in an hour, and sends us on our way. Also, the younger boy is absolutely filthy every single time we pick him up. He stinks of urine and feces, and his skin and hair is always sticky. His teeth are yellow so I don't think she ever brushes them. (Side note, the older boy only has 7 teeth because she neglected to brush them and they all rotted out, and she always had him sleep with a bottle of formula). He has horrible manners, he hits and bites everyone. Her home is full of cats and dogs and the entire house just smells like urine. She lives with her boyfriend, her mom, and her two brothers. One of her brothers has cerebral palsy and no one takes care of him. He always stinks because no one bothers to change his diaper. They lock him in his room where he soils himself all day and they all ignore him. Once she called my husband in a panic because her boyfriend hit the child brutally, then later said it was nothing and he's fine and its none of my husband's business. She is still dating that same guy. My husband desperately wants to get him out of there but he doesn't know where to start, because she won't willingly give him up like she did her other son. 

TL;DR: I want to adopt my older step-son but I don't know how. My husband and I want custody of my younger step-son but we don't know how we can because their mom won't willingly give him up like she did her older son.",0
"Stiffed by Company for Interview Travel Expenses. Hi guys. I don't know what the format is here so I'm just going to go. Also not sure how detailed I should/shouldn't be, so ask for more detail as needed. GA resident, flew to VA for interview.  
  
I was able to make contact with the VA company through a GA recruiter, so GA recruiter handled all the communication. VA company asked for me to make the flight reservation, which I was uncomfortable with because I am accustomed to the company making the reservation. So I asked the GA recruiter to do it for me on their dime, and they agreed.  
  
When I got to the airport, *excuses here*, I missed the flight. I called up the GA recruiter and asked how best to proceed. He told me he would reach out to VA company and call me back. He called back and said they are fine to do the interview later that day or the next day, and that I should book the next flight I can. I specifically asked whether the flight change fee would be reimbursed, and discussed the specific amount it would be with GA recruiter. GA recruiter spoke with the hiring manager and then GA recruiter explicitly told me on the phone that the VA company would reimburse this amount. After this conversation, I booked the flight change, took the flight, rented a car and hotel, and had the interview the next morning.  
  
I submitted my expense reimbursement request with the flight, car rental, hotel, and taxis to and from the airport. A full month later, I received a check from the VA company, reimbursing the car rental, hotel, and taxis. The flight change fee, which was over half the total reimbursement, was not reimbursed.  
  
I called the GA recruiter, and sent subsequent emails because he was picking up on what was going on and not answering calls anymore, and asked what had happened. GA recruiter told me that an ""HR guy"" at VA company had ""put his foot down"" on the flight change expense, and it would not be reimbursed. To my knowledge, GA recruiter has been reimbursed for the flight they booked.  
  
So I figure I have a couple of avenues. One, there's promissory estoppel re: detrimental reliance on GA recruiter's advice. Two, there's some kind of convoluted argument for detrimental reliance on the hiring manager (although I think that would work better for GA recruiter to use on VA company, and GA recruiter is not interested in suing a client, especially on my behalf), even if he didn't have the authority to make that decision. Three, there may be laws around interview reimbursement I haven't really looked into in VA.  
  
I have already reached out to GA recruiter and been told to go pound sand, so any further communication there will likely need to be all lawyered up. I'm not flush with cash, but I am willing to fight this precisely for that reason.  
  
So, uh, advice?",0
"My landlord is kicking me out and treating to sell my stuff.. So this is a long story. My roommates mom was is land lady so she was already always coming in and raising hell because she was mad about other things. Then my roommate decided to take a trip out of town, well apparently she didn't tell her mom. So LL(landlady) calls me and asks whats going on i tell her the truth. She proceeded to scream aand cuss at me like im the scum of the earth. 

This is where the trouble starts. She tells me that i meed to bring her my RM(roommate)'s jeep. Which is not in LL's name, and also the only way i have of getting my RM from the airport when she comes home. So I tell LL ""I cant do that i have to pick up your daughter with it and its not yours."" 

then i block her because i know how she is.  Well the next morning I go home to get some cloths and before I even get out of the jeep she is screaming at me from our neighbors porch. telling me i have to be moved out of there today and cussing me like a dog.

So I knowing a little bit about the law in these situations say. ""you have to give me an eviction notice if you want me to move. you also have to give me more than a day."" 

which of course lead to more yelling and cussing. so I leave in the jeep. A little time passes and her husband, how happens to be a very wealthy lawyer, calls me and suggests I do what she is asking. 

Im not gonna lie i cussed a few times when trying to explain to him why i wasnt bringing the jeep back and how i would have my stuff out by the first of the month since i had already paid rent this month. 

Now they are saying they have people coming to move my stuff today. When my RM came home her mom told her she over reacted, especially on me but since I didn't do what she wanted she had to cme down on me. 

I did a little research and in Alabama you have to give tennants an eviction notice in writing, which I obviously haven't received. It also says that Lanslords cannot evict tennants as a reprocusion. Which is clearly what is going on here. 

RM has been my best friend since we were im like 10th grade so 11 years. In all that time I have always shown LL the upmost respect. I treated her juat lioe my own mother, so it blows my mind that she can be acting this way. 

The police said they could make them stop if they were in the process of moving it but that was it its not like I can stand across the street and make sure no takes anything. So do i just let them do it then sue them? i have no money to hire a lawyer and i dont know if they would take my case with out any.


TL:DR My landlord kicked me out because i refused to bring her a jeep that didn't belong to her. she did so with out giving me an eviction notice, and is threating to dispose of my belongings today. Need to know what i can/should do in this situation.",1
"Help with snowboarding related ticket. Do bench warrants ""expire"" after a certain amount of time?. [TL;DR I have an assumed bench warrant out for my arrest because I failed to show up for an out of state court summons. I was offered a chance to pay a fine after I emailed the Colorado DA but couldn't afford it at the time. Now that I'm wanting to go back to Co, I need to figure out if I even have a bench warrant or anything to pay]

I'm from California and have (had?) a bench warrant out for an unfortunate event that I was ticketed for in Breckenridge, Colorado. I got the the ticket about six years ago and have never taken care of it because I thought I would never be going back to Co.. that is, until a month ago. I was just curious if bench warrants expire after a certain amount of time? I'd like to get this taken care but was curious to know if there'd be anything to even take care of any more. I googled whether or not b.w's expire and I read that after 180 days they fall off, is this true? IF they don't, I'd like to take care of it and was wondering what the best way to do that would be. 

For the backstory: A close friend and I were snowboarding and were riding down a groomed trail when we (stupidly) got the urge to ride down an unmarked section. There was a big gap in the boundary line so we veered off and started down some back country. It wasn't anything insane, just a densely packed forested area with some pretty heavy powder. We ended up going a long way down and basically got stuck as there were no trails or roads at the bottom and going all the way back up in heavy boots was impossible because of how deep the snow was. Finally got a hold of ski patrol who managed to find us from a service road which was literally about 100 feet away.. just couldn't see it from our vantage point (face palm of the century). Shouldn't have happened to begin with though and I certainly learned my lesson.

Ski patrol and police were obviously not very enthused with our decision and we were promptly issued with a summons for a court date set for a few months later. I ended up sending an email to the DA asking if there was anything that could be done so that I didn't have to go all the way back to Colorado and he basically extended an opportunity to just pay a fine (somewhere around $400 I believe). However, I was young and didn't have that kind of money at the time and after a while, just decided to not pay it as I chalked it up to not ever having to go back to Colorado again. Now that I actually want to, I'm worried that I could get arrested on the off-chance I get my id checked. Regardless, I'd like to handle things now that I can afford to pay the fine (if that would still even be an option).

"Cosigned a car loan with now ex girlfriend. This is actually more for my boyfriend than myself, as it's his ordeal but he doesn't have reddit so I figured I could attempt to see how other people have handled similar situations. 

My current SO and his ex girlfriend (we'll call her Jill) cosigned on a car together over a year ago. It was supposed to be just hers but she couldn't get approved for the loan she needed so he apparently thought that it would be fine and agreed to help her out. Fast forward a year and some change, they decided to go their separate ways. Jill moved back to her hometown in New York, we live in Indiana. When she left, she took her car (he didn't want it) on the verbal agreement that she was going to trade it in and eat the fact that it's worth less than they owe on it.

Fast forward through her missing two payments and a lot of calls to the credit union, this has become an absolute nightmare. It's current on payments now due to SO making the payment on the car he doesn't have. Jill is upset because she doesn't want him to come get the car even though she doesn't want to make the payments. Essentially she feels like he owes her something and now that the other two payments are deferred and off his credit, she knows he'd rather suck it up and make the payment then let it hit his credit again. 

She won't respond to texts, calls, emails, etc unless it's the rare occasion that she ""feels like it"" which is usually when she needs something from him or feels like harassing him on that particular day. 

Notes:
-They owe 19,000, the car is worth 14-15,000
-He doesn't care for the car, doesn't really want it. 
-also doesn't want to continue making payments on a car for his ex girlfriend who has now put ~30,000 miles on this car with no oil change and doesn't take care of things to begin with
-Jill does not want to hand over her keys, or cooperate in any form 

The tags on the car expire in two weeks, so those need to be paid. It's up to date on payments now, but in three weeks this will be another go around. 

Clearly there have been several mistakes made here, trust me I am personally appalled by how the entire thing came to be, but that's beside the point. 

Is there anything legally he can do to get the car in his possession, or out of his possession? He just doesn't want to continue to make a payment on a car he doesn't have, and also continue to worry about wether or not she is going to make the payment every month. 

TLDR: Current SO cosigned on a car with his ex. She is in physical possession of the car and won't make the payment (assumingely out of spite) and knows that he will because he doesn't want the ding on his credit. He doesn't care who ends up with the car, just doesn't want to keep paying on a car he doesn't have or worry about her not making the payment.",0
"Can I get my pet back? [NJ]. Hello

I live with my bf and i had a pet (dog/cat, rather not say which) for 2 years before we moved in together. Once we moved in he expressed hatred for my pet. He was willing to deal with it, it seemed. But we got into multiple fights daily because of the pet's behavior. I mentioned once in passing that I feel I might have to give the pet away (this was in no way shape or form permission for him to give away my pet, just a passing thought because of our fighting). But he said, no don't do that. 

One day I go to work and I come home to no pet. He decided to give it to a coworker without my permission or knowledge. Once I expressed to him how upset this made me, he promised to get it back. Well the coworker gave the pet to someone else as a gift, but was willing to work with us. He approached the person he gave the gift to.

Gift receiver said no initially. So we offered money. Person later felt bad when they found out the pet was not a random animal but in fact had a previous owner and was given away without permission(they had no idea the pet was not a stray when they received it as a gift). But would only return animal if money was offered to recoup for expenses ($200). We paid money happily. 

Gift receiver starts giving us the runaround at this point. Keeps promising to return pet if we met at their house, but refused to meet anywhere else. The whole thing was shady and weird but I was desperate. When we arrived at the residence the new owner said hang tight while I find the pet. Never came back to the door. After almost an hour we knock again and they tell bf to come inside. I'm not sure what happened at this point but there was some sort of altercation and pet was never returned. We left. Situation was sketchy and we were worried about our safety. 

My question is, what can we do at this point? This person has agreed to return the pet, with no problem, but now it has been a few months since we initially started going back and forth with these people. I understand the pet was given away but the pet did not belong to the person who gave them away in the first place. And what's more, we paid this person money and now we feel left high and dry. Aside from the situation i have to deal with inside of my relationship because my significant other thought it was okay to give away my beloved pet, what else can i do to deal with new owner?

TL; DR:

Boyfriend gave my pet away without my permission. Person in turn gave pet to someone else as a gift. New owner thought gift was a stray, was not aware it had a previous owner. We offered money in exchange for pet. New owner insisted we meet at their house to pick it up (this was weeks after we paid $200 to them). Upon arrival at new owners house we were met with confrontation and never received my pet. What else can I do?",0
"Real Estate License Suspension/Revocation Help. My mother is a realtor. Last year she plead guilty to several criminal charges unrelated to real estate, but her other business. She is currently serving in a probation program for 3 years for those crimes.

Now Real Estate Commission is trying to suspend/revoke her license with possible fines, given that she plead guilty to these crimes (demonstrating poor conduct, dishonesty, etc.), and that she failed to notify them within 30 days (she didn't know she had to do this, and sent the info immediately after getting notice). They are requesting admission/denial of allegations, upon which they will determine if there's any validity to the disputes to warrant a trial. If not, there will be a hearing where we can provide witnesses/evidence which will decide the final penalty/sanction. 

Obviously the best scenario is avoiding any trial, and having as minimal penalty/sanction/fines as possible. My mother's previous business closed down, she declared bankruptcy and is 64 years old, so financially she has no money - Being a realtor was how she was making ends meet, so this will be a huge blow. That said, we had a consultation with a lawyer and he's quoting a very high retainer fee and billing rate, which we can barely afford. 

Question is: Is it worth it to call the Commission case office directly, before hiring the lawyer, to get an idea of what the possible penalty/sanctions/fines could be in the first place? The lawyer said if we hired him, the first thing he would do is call the Commission to do exactly this, so we're wondering if we can just ask ourselves? 

Our rationale for this is if the penalty/sanctions/fines are actually not that bad, we can avoid wasting money on a lawyer. [I've read through actual outcomes of real estate license cases ('disciplinary actions') as they're all online, and it seems like for people who committed crimes unrelated to real estate, and are already serving in a probation program, the penalty/sanctions/fines aren't that bad...] On the other hand, we can confirm that the Commission is considering a harsh penalty and high fines, in which case, we can just go ahead and hire a lawyer to help get them reduced. I'd like to know if asking the Commission about this is a good idea or one that could bite us in the ass?

TL;DR - mother is realtor and might have her license suspended/revoked for crimes unrelated to real estate. Fines may also be imposed. Mother has no money (bankrupt) and 64 years old, so losing license will be devastating. At the same time, potential Lawyer is asking for very high fee. Wondering if we can call Real Estate Commission case officer directly to get an idea of possible sanctions and fines the have in mind, and go from there, OR if this is a dumb idea and we should just hire lawyer.

"Employer Late Paying Wages (NH). Need a little bit of legal advice. The company I was working for has been in the process of paying me back freelancer invoices back when I was under a 1099 a while ago. During that time period I had gone full-time with them and I was receiving a weekly paycheck.

Back in January/December, the company moved from one state to another and the owner was trying to make that change reflect in our taxes that are taken out as New Hampshire's is lower. There were a few pay periods that were missed, but then I resumed getting new ones again and was told that I would be reimbursed for those that I had not received during the transition, along with the original freelance checks. (At this point some of you may be wondering, why didn't you leave or take action at that point or earlier? Well, this industry is notorious for not paying people, but it is also difficult to find a position like the one that I was in, so I felt like it was the best opportunity and the reputation and experience to me at the time was worth it. I was also fresh out of school at the time.)

During my final 2 weeks which was a few months ago, 2 of the checks that they had written to pay me back for the original missed pay periods had bounced. Also, during those 2 weeks I didn't receive an automatic deposit, so I approached my employer about it. They basically said that they had a lot less money to pay me than they thought and that it wasn't fair for me to continue to work there while I wasn't getting paid.

I'm not really privy to the behind the scenes accounting, but I can't imagine they're particularly good at it. My employer wrote up a document to basically say that they were suspending payment for a while and verbally said that they would look to get me paid back within 4 weeks. Verbally, they said that want to bring me back on full-time again once the work picks up. Its been about 2 months, and I have received a replacement check for one of those missed pay periods, but I haven't received word on when I will be expecting more.

Basically, I'm trying to figure out what sort of legal power/ability I have under my control between the freelancer checks, the full-time missed pay periods, the bounced checks, and the sudden suspension of employment even though I was under contract. I'm definitely tired of waiting around and even though I would hate to break off the relationship with this company, money is more important to me at this point. If they are legitimately ""out of money"" I understand that they can only do so much to pay me back, but they lacked the foresight to deal with that preemptively and allowed me to work without receiving payments. I also feel like they are doing what they can to pay me back, as I have received one of the replacement checks, so I'm not sure if that changes anything from a legal perspective.",0
"[US] Discrimination victim lost suit, ordered to pay ""minimal"" legal fees as a result. How to negotiate?. I was the victim of a discrimination suit several years ago in the US. Due to the organization being so high profile they were able to shut down the case in summary judgement and spread misinformation (the judges admitted that they didn't understand the nuances of the case, and had very strong ties to organization in question).

I don't understand it 100% but I was told that I would be responsible for some legal fees if I lost. They tried to cut a deal with me by asking me not to appeal the case and then they wouldn't charge it but I appealed anyway. From what I understand the fees are capped to bare basics like filing fees etc so I wouldn't be responsible for something like 200k+ but more like 700-800 dollars. This is a drop in the bucket for them but very costly for me.

I understand that I am legally responsible for these fees, however as a direct result of this case and the emotional trauma I suffered at the hands of this organization, I lost that job, became almost unemployable due to Googling my name shows this failed court case, had to move in with family because I was desperate to have somewhere to live, had to flee that situation because of domestic abuse at the hands of my family, and have been homeless since the beginning of the year. For some reason they are deciding to try to contact me regarding those fees now of all times when I am literally homeless.

This has really reopened my trauma and I think it's deeply inappropriate for them to try to do this at this time especially when they had a part in creating this situation. I understand that legally I promised to pay those fees. I wanted to ask a) can I appeal to a judge about my situation or did I already promise all that time ago? and b) can I tell them that I will go public with this story and create negative PR for them if they decide to move forward?

This whole time I went the legal route instead of the press route because I didn't want to be in the spotlight but I wonder if things would have turned out differently because there would have been pressure for them to be held accountable. If they are choosing to really push to get those fees after all this time when I have hit rock bottom I don't see why I shouldn't reveal what they are doing to the press.

Also please be kind with this post and don't put down and disrespect my situation or my trauma. I understand this is just one side of the story but please take it at face value without judging or victim blaming. I have been through a lot with this and I will report and flag comments that are cruel and unhelpful. Please just answer the question as asked, I do understand that I agreed to this, but is there any leverage I can use with the judge or with the organization itself to pressure them to drop it?",0

She moved in 7/16 and is a single mother (her kids live w/us)and student divorcing her abusive husband is prison so landlord/employer was sympathetic to her &amp; became a friend/mentor or so she thought after learning of husband's arrest for domestic violence (he noticed her bruises) He started gaving her extra $ on days he was there &amp; involving her in his horse competitions and she became friendly with his girlfriend, BTW he's 60ish and a wealthy workaholic contractor. In March her new  boyfriend walked out to meet him in the barn and he angrily asked who he was then turned around &amp; left. Afterwards, days then weeks would pass without him exercising his horses or removing manure he was responsible for disposing of. My daughter's not allowed to ride horses without him present and she was limited in ""lunging"" them in paddock during high temperatures, she knew he was neglectful but didn't want break his rules. Now 3 months later, after she asked for a/c repairs which were ignored, he's ordered her to move out within 30 days (CA law is 60 days for 1 yr+) he's still angry after she called gas company to check gas dryer but on inspection, they required him to install new water heater/stove which were previously flagged, never cleared from previous violation, they told her there's only one meter so she's been paying gas for other renter (never disclosed)  FYI he's 65, who owns a land dev. business far away &amp; doesn't hire legit people to fix things correctly. He's accusing her of neglecting the horses when she cares for them as if her own. He's harassed her when he brought out new, inexperienced girl to take over her job while she's still living there so she wants to find a place &amp; move out immediately but I told her to think first, not run away as he is counting on. He used to tell her to speak up for herself when he was a ""friend"" and I hoped I was wrong after cautioning her about his motivations.  His accusations include things she's not responsible for such as trimming trees, watering dead grass when he has no sprinklers, regardless of city water restrictions. He's unprofessional and using his personal feelings towards her to fuel this. BTW she hasn't yet paid rent this month, leaving it to the deposit he said he was going to keep, now she's got a 3 day notice to pay or quit. Best advice? Sorry for length, I shared details of personal nature for insight to his personal vendetta against her.",1
"Neighbor is harassing my family with continuously loud music.. I live in California, and about a year ago we got a new neighbor. My family has lived in this house for almost 30 years and have never had a problem with neighbors before this.

Since he has moved in he has completely renovated his house, installed an outdoor pool and a bunch of cinder block walls around his property. With the addition of multiple cameras (at one point he had one pointing directly at our backyard/backdoor), his house and yard are hidden completely from the street. 

From practically day 1 he has been hosting loud parties that go all day and long into the night. This has progressed into him installing an outdoor speaker that looks like this one:
https://www.amazon.com/degree-Outdoor-speaker-Sound-Appeal/dp/B00C41AUDU 

My problem is he has this speaker set up between our houses in a yet to be completed driveway. It does nothing to help the acoustics of his parties, instead it is about 10-15 feet from my bedroom window, and he plays music with driving base parts all day and all night, EVERY DAY. It keeps me awake until well after 10:30pm, and wakes me consistently around 6:30-7am every day. 

I have called the police repeatedly and most of the time they don't even show up. When they do he doesn't even answer the door for them. This neighbor has set the volume such that it isn't loud enough to bother any of the surrounding neighbor enough to stand with my family in trying to end this psychological warfare. This isn't even the extent of the harassment, only the most obnoxious and persistent.

We know that he's upset that my parents are beekeepers because of emails between my mother and him. He claims we are endangering his wife's life, because she's allergic to bees, and has threatened to call code enforcement on us if we don't remove the bees. We have tried to educate them on the fact that bees are EVERYWHERE and even if we didn't care for them, the minute danger of being stung by bees is easily avoidable if you don't aggravate them. 

This neighbor has made good on his threats and called code enforcement on everything that he can, from the bees themselves to structural integrity of the out-building they are living on. We are dealing with the legwork and paperwork for this but all of this is placing undue stress and suffering on my family and I need help. 

I have pictures and a video (that I don't think I can post here) of this speaker playing music near my bedroom window, but my family doesn't have the money to fight this asshole (who seems to have more money than most third world countries), and I'm reaching my wits end with this asshole. 

TLDR: Asshole neighbor plays loud bass music all day every day, watches my family looking for anything and everything he can to make our lives miserable. All because he's afraid that his wife will get stung by bees and die.",1
"Need Legal Advice - Wife might have signed a contract for a shady summer job (in New Jersey). Thank you for reading this and I understand that this is not exactly the official advice I should run into a courtroom with but I will take any and all advice and suggestions.

Long story short; my wife accepted a post at a summer job for eight weeks and signed a contract for this position.  This post is in New Jersey. The contract is for an 8 week position and she is to be paid $2450 total for all 8 weeks.

First question: As this position requires her to work from at least 8:30 AM to 4 PM Monday through Friday, that makes a total of 37.5 official working hours per workweek. She's getting $306.25 per week. That translates to $8.17 an hour and in NJ, minimum wage is $8.44 and hour. Is that legal to hire employees via a contract for under minimum wage? Does it matter if it is a seasonal position?

Second question, going with the 7.5 hours of a work day, she is not given any breaks during the day. She has to set up for the next 'class' and she was told that her break is at 5 PM. Remember, her shift ends at 4 PM. Is that also legal? I thought labor laws required employees to take a break roughly every 5 hours.

Third question; is mandatory orientation and training required to be paid to the new hiree? She was told she had to attend these events which took place on three Saturdays prior to her starting date. Each event was roughly 8 hours. She also has had to work other events prior to the start of job such as a ""meet the parents"" night. She has not seen any compensation for this.

Besides teaching during the 7.5 hours per day, she was told she has to drive a minivan to pick up coworkers and clients and that she would be given $600 as a bonus for the 8 weeks of doing this. That breaks down to $75 per week which is $15 per day. The route is roughly an hour each way and that's not including her time to refuel the vehicle and do the mandatory safety inspection checklist of the vehicle to make sure the vehicle is in proper working conditions.

Furthermore the work van is being rented from a company and my wife's name is not on the contract for the vehicle nor is she listed as an authorized driver for the vehicle. 

What would be the ramifications if she was driving the vehicle and something happened? The company she was hired by claims they have their own insurance for the vehicle but with all the other questionable activity, I no longer trust that situation. 

Also, what would be the ramifications for her leaving this position before the eight weeks are up? She has a full time job throughout the year but summers are off. This job was mainly just for a little extra summer spending money.

I hope my rant made some sense; I am going by this handle rather than my normal handle to avoid having her identity exposed. Thank you all for your help, time, and support.",0
"[California] My employer is bullying my co-workers, and I have a flair for the dramatic.. Hello /r/legaladvice,

I work for a privately owned retail chain you may of heard of in the news recently, and we've come under new store management at our outlet here in San Diego county. While I accepted this manager with an open mind and hope, she's done nothing but demoralize my fellow co-workers. She seems to be incapable of separating numbers on a spreadsheet from human beings, but I digress. To keep this succinct, let me jump into actions she's taken and the California labor codes I believe she's broken.

I'm aware of multiple employees she's disciplined for ""excessive absences"". She gave a write-up to one of our pregnant employees who was absent for 3 consecutive days for scabies (a highly contagious and uncomfortable skin disease caused by an infestation of insects **burrowing** into your skin), despite proper documentation from a doctor. She gave a write-up to an employee for missing work due to a family emergency. She gave a write-up to an employee for absences that were clerical errors (she had switched shifts with another employee and had it manager sanctioned, but they marked her absent *by mistake*). The list goes on, and she's expressed plans to reprimand more. Although I myself have not had anything done unjust to myself, likely because I'm leaving soon, I can no longer stand by and let this happen.

I've done my research, and I believe this violates California Labor Code § [233](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;sectionNum=233) &amp; [234](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;sectionNum=234) (tl;dr: an employer can't discipline an employee for sick time off if they don't exceed what they've been allocated by the company, and none of my aforementioned instances have done that). Since this happened to so many and will likely happen to more, it would be difficult to spread this knowledge to everyone verbally. So my plan is to arm my co-workers *en masse*. I intend to print these labor codes and covertly post them in the break-room with the title: ""Have you been punished for absences lately? This may interest you:"". I'm quite sure it'll be taken down very quickly, but I trust the rumor mill and a few backup copies should cover this.

So my question is; am I understanding these labor laws correctly, and what do you think? I am also open to suggestions of all sorts, as well as opinions on how I'm going about this.

It should also be mentioned, I'm sure they'll suspect me. My co-workers (and managers) have grown accustom to my taste in mischief/shenanigans, and often turn to me first when something of the sort has happened. They are almost always correct in doing so. Although I don't intend to admit to doing this, my employer is an ""at will"" company.",0
"Ticket for crossing the CN railroad with seconds to spare before light flashing (near Lachine Canal, QC, Canada). [near Lachine Canal, QC, Canada]
So, I fucked up really badly. I don't know what to do or how exactly I should proceed, so I'm turning to good ol' reddit. Disclaimer: I have a very severe anxiety disorder, and panic attacks are a usual occurrence for me. So, I left work 45 minutes earlier than usual today, because I was feeling dizzy, had heart palpitations and a high blood pressure. I needed to lie down, so my boss gave me the OK to leave. Living 45min away from work (traffic), I started heading home at 3:17pm. It is now ~3:45pm, and I'm 10/13min away from home, finally. I start to feel uneasy once again, and decide I really do need to get get my blood pressure under control, considering the possibility of needing to go to the hospital. I get to the stop sight right before the train tracks. It is my turn to proceed, and as I start to accelerate, a grey van perpendicular to where I was decides it's her turn to go as well. I brake suddenly to avoid an potential accident. At that point, I'm beginning a panic attack, and I get flustered. The grey van is now in front of me (don't have the plates, I was too panicky to think of that), so I accelerate along with it. At that point, the lights and sirens of the train tracks are getting louder and stronger... The grey van and I are stranded on the middle or the train tracks and I'm panicking even more. The grey van then accelerates quickly, but just as it passes the tracks, the wooden bar comes down in front of me. I react right away and reverse as quick as possible, only to have the second bar fall right on top of my car's roof (FUCK ME). I'm panicking, scared.. and what comes next? The police comes out of nowhere, sirens and lights blaring. I'm happy they were there, because it calmed me down and they helped me get off the tracks.. however, as a repercussion, I got a 139$ ticket (which is not what I'm upset about). With the ticket, I got a monetary fine, but I also got 4 demerit points. Keep in mind: I have a probationary license, which only has 4 points on it. Bam, licence is lost for 24 months. I fucking lost my license because some guy decided to cut me off at the stop sign. I'm turning 18 in 5 days, so things would've been different. Damage to the car and rail were minimal, thank goodness. Anyhow, the police tells me that both my infractions led up to the ticket I received, and that the guy in front of me was in the wrong, however I was the one who got caught under the bar, and I was the one they caught/had to first help out. I will be contesting the ticket via lawyers from Tickets911, however I want some outside and objective opinions about this. What should I do? What are my chances? What can I do to at least get 1 point back, to possibly be able to keep my license? Any opinions/tips are welcome. Thanks, reddit.",0
"Tips were garnished from me as a pizza delivery boy (in store). Hey, guys. 

I live in Newport Beach, CA. 

My situation is complex and I will try to explain it to the best of my ability. I was employed by a family owned pizza place in Newport Beach, CA. The business had three locations. As a delivery boy, I would drive pizzas to the person who placed the order and received the money to pay for the pizza along with a cash tip. I would pocket this. If the pizza was paid for through a credit card, I would obtain a signature from the customer. If the customer chose to give me a tip, it was available for them to tip above the signature on the receipt. I was cashed out in full at the end of the night. 

This is not problematic. 

This is what is problematic. 

I never received any cash tips from inside the restaurant (there was a tip jar) and never received any credit tips that were left on a receipt. I have filed a wage claim form, gone through a preliminary conference, and now I am scheduled for a hearing. My ex-boss is claiming the following: 

ALL THREE LOCATIONS EARNED $220 IN A TWO WEEK PERIOD OR $440 IN A MONTH   

This would mean each store earned around $15 a day just in tips. (keep in mind we are in Newport Beach, CA, there is no way the stores made that little per day).  

I almost know for a certainty that the locations earned way more than this amount. How can I make sure he is telling the truth? How can I refute this? 

He is also claiming this: 

BECAUSE (my name) WAS A DRIVER, (my name) WAS NOT ENTITLED TO IN-STORE TIPS. ONLY SERVERS WERE ENTITLED TO SAID TIPS. 

1. My ex-boss never distributed tips to any other employees, if he did, the amount was always $20 and was allocated every month, not every two weeks. From co-workers, I have heard that they claimed to never have been tipped out and never have received any kind of tips (these are the people working as cashiers) 

2. On a busy night, as a driver, I would take at most 6 or 7 deliveries that averaged 2 hours to 2 hours and 20 minutes of driving time and delivery of pizzas. Keep in mind this was only on an extremely busy night. Usually, more often than not, I would take 3 to 4 deliveries which would average at about 1 hour to about 1 hour and 20 minutes. My shifts were 4-5 hours long. During the times I was not driving, I was serving guests alongside the cashiers. I would take phone orders, place orders in person, interact with guests, take food to tables, clear tables, clean the restaurant, bathrooms, do dishes, etc etc etc (My point is that I served many many people and my ex-boss is claiming that because my position was a ""driver"" that I was not entitled to any form of tips) 

How can I prove that I served food and his logic is flawed and not factual? 

I have most if not all of my pay stubs and I have all my W-2s. 

Please please please please help.

"[Ontario, Canada] Working as a contractor on a 3-month job, broke my ankle a few days into the contract, not sure how. Non-resident of Ontario (home is NS). How do I protect myself if I need to file a workplace injury claim? And since I have healthcare regardless, do I really need to?. I'm 50 years old.

After a 24 year absence from physically demanding work I got back into an old career, in the intervening years I was a desk jockey and pretty weak &amp; out of shape due to sedentary lifestyle and no real exercise.

Also a type 2 diabetic for the last 13 years, with major numbness in my feet/legs, and have a little trouble balancing. I can get tripped up easily and take extra precautions when climbing.

My first three days on the job I was on a 15-foot ladder, going up and down a lot, and spent ten hour days on my feet with lots of climbing and walking. It was hell, but by the end of the first week I was stronger. But after the third day I was noticing a serious pain and swelling in my right ankle. I chalked this up to muscles getting used that hadn't been used in years and simply powered through it, hardly able to walk, but did it anyway, ten hours a day. Yesterday (end of second week of work) I just couldn't bear the pain anymore and it was not improving in any way - only getting worse. I'm limping badly all over the workplace, nobody even asks if I'm okay.

Left work a couple hours early and went to the ED yesterday at the local hospital, after an examination and x-ray doc calls me over and shows me the imaging, he literally says ""wtf"" as he points out a shard of bone broken off one of my ankle bones and is sitting in the lower part of my ankle in the spot where the swelling is. They give me an air cast and are supposed to be arranging an appointment with an orthopedic specialist this week. I didn't want this to wreck my work contract (I need the money) so he wrote me a note saying I cannot climb ladders or do any climbing whatsoever, and that the cast must stay on for six weeks. I can walk with the cast on, but it's not fun. Also on Indomethacin for inflammation.

I called off sick today, but my next workday is Wednesday and I plan to show up, cast and all, and ask if there are any duties I can be given that don't involve climbing or ladders. I have no idea if they'll go for it or if they'll just call off the contract and send me packing.

Have no idea what my rights are, or if being a contractor makes any difference. I suspect the injury happened in the first couple of days when I was hopping off the last rung or two of the ladder, but I never reported anything to anyone at the time. How will the fact that I have diabetes and leg/foot numbness play into this? My right leg/foot is weak due to a back injury in the early 90's as well. I ended up with a 30% permanent partial disability due to this, adjudicated by the Workers Comp Board of Texas.

Thanks very much for any advice you can give.",0
"My company got bought by a bigger one, many of my colleagues got offered share options, I did not. Still have a low salary, and job title was degraded (London, UK). Hi All,

So apologies if this isn't the right place to post this, but I wasn't sure where else to turn, and didn't know if I had any legal options here.

So in a nutshell, I've been with my company for just over 3 and a half years. During that time I've had a few pay rises, but nothing too dramatic - started on £20k, year later £24k, year later £28k. I know that sounds like quite big jumps, but I've gone above and beyond for these guys - worked loads of (unpaid) hours of overtime, and considering how much I do for them, it's low for what I should be paid (many of my colleagues have told me this).

So it came to the time of year for the meeting I have to discuss my future/salary. Only this time they say they can't pay me any increase, due to changes at the company. Instead, they say they'll offer 'profit share' to us. What this meant, was a small percentage of our profits would come to me every quarter, this worked out to about £800/quarter. So not a great deal, but better than nothing. I tell them I'm invested in the company, I want to be here for the long haul, and if they can't offer me money, I'd be more than happy to take share options in the company. They didn't give me an answer on this.

Fast forward 6 months - we're told the company is being bought out. I organise a meeting to stress that I'm really due a pay rise (or share options) and stress that I don't want to start at the new place on a low salary, as that'll make me seem like a low level employee to them. They say they can't do anything until we start at the new place. 

At the new place, they say we're all going to keep our jobs, and the salary will be in line with what we've had before. I'm offered £29k (so a £1k increase). Not great. My title changes from Production Manager to 'Creative Accountant Executive') - which does also feel like a step down. I'm told we'll have a meeting in the coming weeks to discuss this all, but I'm eating fed up of waiting by this point.

Anyway, we start a the new place. It's pretty cool, much the same as my last place, exact same kind of job, with some new duties. I go down the pub that night to discuss how it was for my colleagues, and they tell me something interesting - they were all offered share options in the new company (shares at a discounted cost). They got offered more depending on seniority, and if they didn't want to take them, they were offered a bonus. Admittedly, I'm the youngest of them  - the next oldest colleague has been with them just over 5 years. But he was offered in the region of £50k. Which seems a lot. Maybe I'm missing something,I don't claim to know all the details -  but should I not have been even considered for this? Do I have any legal precedent to stand on? Please advise, any help much appreciated.",0
"(MA) University Denied Payment for Past Due Balance, Has Been Holding Degree for 5 Years. Hello!

I finished a degree program in Liberal Arts from a large college in Missouri back in 2012.

This was a *huge* accomplishment because back in 2009, my dad cut off my support. I dropped out of school and started working waiting tables, took night classes, finished an Associates at the local community college, and re-enrolled at the large university in 2010. I worked nights and went to school during the day to finish.

When I walked across that stage, I had done it all on my own. Great feeling, right?

Well, in my last semester, I was almost kicked out for non-payment. A financial aid officer had Mercy on my soul, and removed the hold on my account so I could graduate. I completed all my coursework, but my degree was never actually awarded. This is important for the actual question, which I'm getting to I swear y'all.

Anyway, I did a year of AmeriCorps service, and came away with a Segal Award for $5730. The balance I owe my university was originally $7500, but due to finance charges is $11k. However, they're willing to accept $9k and release my degree.

I was accepted into a Master's program to continue my work in Youth Education, but they wouldn't let me begin without my official transcript. People in my community fundraised for me, and I was able to get the remaining amount. Then the university refused to accept my AmeriCorps award, stating that it can not be used on a previous balance.

I have contacted the National Service hotline twice, and both times supervisors have stated that since my degree was never actually awarded, and the university would require me to re-enroll before awarding my degree, the balance would count as current. Additionally, the balance stays current as it accrues the finance charge every month.

At this point, I know I need to retain an attorney and just have them reach an agreement this way. I'm planning to seek out low cost legal services here in the Greater Boston area, hopefully via Harvard Law when their clinics start back up.

I'm curious what sort of letter needs to be drafted. What's reasonable to ask them to do? I want them to accept the award, and allow me to go on a payment plan for the remainder, and *hopefully* reduce the finance charges a little closer to the original balance. (I spent the gifted money on living expenses; I have a new baby and didn't have much of a choice since I couldn't begin my Master's program and use loan money from that for living expenses. Not ideal, I know, but I'm desperate.)

It should be noted that, in a last ditch effort, I sent the Provost a letter about 3 months ago, but never got a response back. The Provost makes like $375k a year, I doubt she could even begin to understand what I'm dealing with or cared at all.

"[USA] Received notice for Ford class action lawsuit; I don't believe I'm eligible, but is it worth looking in to?. I purchased a certified used 2014 Ford Focus in July 2015 from a Ford dealership. Within a month of ownership, I began to have clutch shudder issues; I eventually got this repaired under warranty by a local Ford dealership. 

I've also had two recall notices within a year of ownership; one was for a faulty sensor, and one was for a defective piece in my door which could cause my door to fly open while the car is in motion. The door recall stated that an additional notice would come out when parts were available for this repair; it took around 8 months for me to get notice I was now eligible for repair. I got the sensor repaired under warranty.

The class action settlement notice says these are the following conditions:

&gt; If your vehicles transmission is malfunctioning, you may be entitled to a repair or a repurchase of your vehicle, through an expedited binding arbitration program created by the Settlement. (I am not currently having transmission issues to my knowledge, but I am getting an oil change by a trusted mechanic this week, and am tempted to have him give my engine/transmission/sensors a once over.)

&gt; If an authorized Ford dealer performed three or more transmission software flashes on your vehicle, you may be entitled to cash payment ranging from $50-$600, depending on the number of visits. 

&gt; If an authorized Ford Dealer replaced three or more qualifying hardware parts on your PowerShift transmission while you owned the vehicle, you may be entitled to cash payments ranging from $200-$2,325 or Vehicle Discount Certificates ranging in value from $400 to $4,650, depending on the number of service visits. (I definitely don't qualify for this; I only had one transmission repair, and one sensor repair).

&gt; If you paid for a repair for the Powershift transmission that you think should have been covered by warranty, you may be entitled to be reimbursed. (My warranty covered my repair)

&gt; If your vehicle was manufactured after June 5, 2014 and two or more clutch replacements were performed on your vehicle under warranty, and you had to pay for a clutch replacement after warranty, you may qualify for reimbursement.  (I only had one official clutch repair under warranty.)

It says that if I do nothing, I will be named as a part of this class action lawsuit, and can claim benefits (but cannot sue Ford at a later date).  I don't think I qualify, so I don't see any point in me remaining in it. However, I don't see any issue with seeing where this goes, seeing how my car performs over the next few months (the suit will be filed in August 2017), and the hearing will take place in October 2017. Given the sheer amount of issues I have had with this vehicle since purchasing it, I don't want to exclude myself in case I suddenly do start having more transmission issues.

"[NJ] Just was attacked and had to use my pepper spray. I went to a big box store and parked. When I got out I was stuck between two large SUV which limited my view going back. I honestly slowly went back when a car blasted their horn and sped. I would say around me but at no time were we closer than 8 feet. I let it go I did not even honk back or give them the finger or yell anything to them.

I had already put my windows down because the temperature was only ~80 degrees. My mistake. I happened to use the same exit as that person because there are only really two ways to get out.

I left at least one car space probably more. The passenger gets out of the car. Cars are coming into the big box store so I cannot go around. I am blocked on the right by a sidewalk and the passenger coming at me. There are cars already behind me.

The guy comes at me with fists drawn and in a threatening manner already yelling ""I am going to kick your fucking ass."" I panic and remembered I had pepper spray. I fumble for it as he is already at my car screaming. I yell ""GO back to your car"" at least 4 times and he takes a swipe at me and then spits at me right into my face and eye. I spray the pepper spray directly into his face. He immediately walks away and then his wife (driver of car) starts screaming at me. I call 911 the moment the situation was calmer.

He and she are screaming at me. I finally close my window (I forgot to do that) The police are there in about two minutes which is really quick. I tell my story. The other guy is warned to stay over there cause he keeps trying to get close to me. The police tell me that his story does not make sense and to tell me my story twice now. 4 more officers come. I tell them each and they warned me that I might be arrested because pepper spray is ""illegal"" in new jersey and that ""spitting does not constitute an assault""

Luckily a supervisor says that my pepper spray (bought on amazon which limits which size I can buy in my state) is legal and that spitting does constitute an assault or something else. I was still quite amped up to understand exactly what he said.

At the end, all of the officers told me had it happened to them they would have done the same or even more (one officer said I would have beat the living shit out of him) But they gave me my license, my pepper spray back, and a police report number no ticket was issued to me. I am not sure of the other person.

They said that the passenger already said that he will be pressing charges against me. The police told me at 9 am Monday to go to the police station pick up the police report and file charges against the passenger.

I would like to know what am I facing? Can I use a self defense claim? I never left the vehicle, he came into my vehicle trying to punch me and spit into my face.

What would I counter charge him with? Can I press charges against the driver of the vehicle as well as she preventing me from leaving.

"[NJ] Do I have to give my roommate his security deposit back?. In a nutshell: monthly tenant paid an unofficial security deposit, abruptly decided to move out, now wants it back.

A few years ago Roommate A moved into this 3-bedroom apartment with two other people. They signed a 1-year lease and put down a security deposit in the amount of one month's rent. No new lease was ever signed and eventually the other two original tenants moved out and were replaced by various people throughout the years who never signed anything and paid month to month. I moved in last September and Roommate A said not to worry about a deposit. Roommate B moved in months later and was told the same. Around May one of the original tenants had their car stolen and needed money so A asked us for a deposit. Roommate B gave a month's rent which went to the carless original tenant. I never did, being wary that A might not get the full deposit back. 

Roommate A moved out at the end of June. Roommate C is  scheduled to move in in August and when we told the landlord she said she wanted the three of us to sign a new lease and put down a full security deposit. Roommate B gave every indication that he would be signing the lease and staying long term, as he had always intended. On July 11, B announces he had been secretly looking for a new apartment, had just been approved, and would be moving out on August 1st. This put me and Roommate C in a tight spot as we had no idea how the landlord would react or if/how soon we could find a replacement. After a lot of scrambling around we find Roommate D. The landlord approves C and D and tells me I can give the security deposit directly to Roommate A, who only asks for 2/3 of the amount since B had paid in May. B now wants his deposit back.

I'm hoping that because B broke the terms of his implied month-to-month lease by not giving proper notice he has no right to recover any security deposit. Also, his girlfriend has been secretly living here after the landlord clearly said no one could move in short term or without her approval. The landlord indicated to me that technically Roommate A had been liable for the entirety of the original lease and everyone not on it. It seemed that paying him the deposit transferred the liability to me, C, and D. If we had given A the full amount would he have had the right to keep B's deposit even though he wasn't living there when B broke his terms? If so, does that right transfer to us? Am I entitled to the deposit since only B and I were here when he broke the terms? Is the landlord entitled to that money? Is giving only 20 days notice not enough to lose a deposit? Do we owe B his deposit back? He was a real dick about this whole thing I really don't want him walking away with zero repercussions, though obviously I'd like to have legal grounds to refuse him the money instead of just spite. If we can't keep it I'd rather C, D, and me pay the remaining 1/3 to A or the landlord than give it back to B.",1
"Advice on what to do after Sanctions are imposed and shes violated every single one.. also posted in /r/Custody So, my ex and I broke it off March of last year. She moved in with some ""roomate"" guy, but didn't end up really being just that, of course. She didn't think I would go through with anything related to courts, but we couldn't agree on a school. I was moving back to a county with 10/10 schools (which I attended), and she wanted him to attend a charter school which was nothing I wanted him to experience, as it it was in a run down area, etc. I hired a lawyer, fought for school of choice, went to a referee hearing and somehow she had a lawyer (last minute, she was terrible), and I won with flying colors. She objected to the recommendation, went in front of a judge some months later, and she was definitely ill prepared again, and the judge sided with me. (He was very mad that she refused to take him to ANY school, hers or mine, for 2 months until he made his decision. I was taking him to my school since it started, and she was taking him nowhere on her days). We were supposed to go to mediation. She didn't show. My lawyer filed sanctions against her, for the attorney fees of $1800 for preparing for mediation and her missing it, and asked the judge for 5 days with me instead of 50%, and he almost granted it. Said ""Do you see what's going on here?"" She really kind of looked foolish in the judges eyes. The judge granted the sanctions, and it was ORDERED that she not be late at all dropping him off to school or picking him up. We were prepared to enter another mediation. I told her we could sign a parenting time agreement and we would not need to go. That night, she signed it, and all was well. Which brings me to now. Every. Single. Part. Of. The. Order. she hasn't complied with. Hasn't paid the mediator the $100 she owed him (in the order), hasn't paid me or set up a payment plan with my attorney for $1800 (in the order), and has been late to drop him off 20+ times (in the order that that cannot happen). I'm trying to be lenient because of her situation, living 20+ min away, moving into her best friends house instead of her ""roomates"" (that didn't turn out well, duh). And now, I find out she's an escort to old men. That's not OK, knowing her history into getting into risky situations, and I'm worried for things going down hill from there. I work too hard and spent too much for my son to be in an unsafe and unstable environment like that. So I let her know my knowledge of this, and she kind of avoids talking about it. Yesterday, I bring up that I'm taking actions based on her willingly violating every single aspect of that court order. I'm hoping that will change her actions, because I'm scared of what will happen if she continues, and worry about my son first and foremost. http://imgur.com/a/uXOrB http://imgur.com/a/xOGNj Pictures for reference. I'm wondering what in your opinion would be the best course of action for correcting her behavior. Contempt? Thank you!",0
"Workplace sexual harassment. My mother has been sexually harassed at her workplace for about a year or more. She works at a big name energy company that priorities safety for their employees in the workplace as their number one commitment (I know, I've worked with this company as a summer student many years). My mother and father live in this small company town (about 650 population) and they both work for this company at different places/roles. I live a province away and I've heard most of this through my father and sister (who still lives home). 

My parents marriage has been suffering so much over the past year and it was seriously stressing out my sister and I as well. My father, sister and I could tell that my mother wasn't the same as she once was, always hiding away from us/people, getting mad with us for no particular reason, blaming my father for things that isn't his fault and just all around being distant and not being a part of the family. I don't even know how to explain this. 

Now this may have been going on for more than a year but my mother only told us about her struggles within the last month. I don't know all the details. I know he has touched her body sometimes, talked about her body, and tried to convince her to have an affair. For a year, or more. She had to put up with this kind of guy. I know this guy who harassed her almost ruined her marriage (or still may) as well as part of her life. And perhaps the rest of her life will be altered by this too. My mother is very old school and didn't even want to tell us or let HR of this company know about what has been going on. She doesn't want to ruin the life of the guy who has been harassing her and his family (it's a small town everyone knows everyone) and she doesn't want people to know this has been happening in case they judge her, even if she gets moved to a different work area to get away from him. She thinks that people won't like her or be different around her because she told on him. She's insecure. My mother is on antidepressants to deal with this. She pushed her family members away to deal with this. She's done crazy things she never would have thought about doing before- driving 12 hours away from the town to get away, contemplate suicide, etc. 

Today, he got called into HR to discuss what has been happening and he has denied ALL of it. HR said they need proof. We understand that. The problem is: there is no proof. No texts. No interaction over social media. No cameras. No co workers have seen (and my mother is convinced if they did, they wouldn't say anything). My mother said she knew this would happen because the guy told her that if she told ever told anyone, he would deny all of it. My mother wrote out specific scenarios that occurred with this guy who harassed her. The HR manager believes my mother but can not do anything without proof. My mother has written 15 pages of what this guy has said and done to her. These 15 pages made my father cry.

"TX - employer is refusing to pay final paycheck. So my ex-employer is a real shady POS (tax fraud, insurance fraud, etc). So the story is that for the past 2 months, he's been having big-time money problems, which caused our last four paychecks to be 7-10 days late. But then he got a loan for a couple hundred k, and now we have money again. My last paycheck was supposed to be 07/03, but I was on PTO (we don't have a written PTO policy, but other employees have taken PTO without any ramifications, and he said I could take it) until 07/05. While I was gone, he kept pressuring me to DocuSign this NDA and non-compete. He still owes me $3k for unpaid medical expenses (signed employment contract states medical coverage is part of benefits, but our insurance was retroactively cancelled in April, which caused all my doctor appointments from January to April to be rejected by insurance, so small bills became huge). He's promised to pay this back numerous times, but of course, he hasn't. I told him I'd sign the NDA/Non-compete out of goodwill, but I expected him to honor his contract and pay me for consequential damages caused by the insurance cancelling. When I return to the office, he seizes my phone and laptop (I'm guessing to get rid of my evidence I've collected against him) and locks me out of my emails. I took this as termination, even though he said it wasn't (I'm sure this was a ploy to get me to stay, so he could further insulate himself from potential damage), but since I wasn't paid, I was out of there. So I sent him a demand letter since he has 6 days to pay me my final paychecks. My question is this: I know he's going to claim that my PTO was unauthorized, but can I claim that's discriminatory because other employees literally took PTO the week before and it didn't affect their paycheck. He also told me to send the hours I was into the office, knowing that none of the employees had been to the office (yet again, none of them had to fill out time sheets) because 1. we hadn't been paid yet and 2. creditors were coming into the office threatening to blow or shoot the place up until they got their money. I was still working, and I had text messages/emails of 1. asking for him to pay server costs, so I could continue working on the website and 2. him sending me to various companies to collect bills on our company's behalf (also promising to pay my medical reimbursement if I managed to collect checks). Will he be able to deny me my last paycheck by claiming I didn't go into the office. And should I threaten what I have on him (tax fraud, insurance fraud)? I also have access to technical systems I set up (and technically own because I bought them with my own money in case something like this happened). Should I take down the systems, or will this backfire on me and allow him to sue me for damages or something. This is really complicated because this guys was SOOOO unscrupulous, sloppy, and corrupt. What do you guys propose is the best course of action? Thanks so much!",0
"Is this medical billing/collections/insurance fraud?. Last year, I went in to a California urgent care center because I ended up having strep throat. I gave them my Aetna PPO insurance, paid the $75 copay, and then went on my merry way to the pharmacy. This was about a year ago.

I did a credit report check recently, and to my surprise a $200 bill had been placed into collections over 6 months ago, with the urgent care center listed as the original account holder. So I call this urgent care, which is located in a small shopping mall and is not attached to a hospital or any other medical offices. The receptionist pulls up my account and tells me that she sees that I paid the copay, but that they have nothing to do with further billing, as they send all their claims to a contracted medical billing office for insurance collection, which is apparently the standard in the industry. She kindly gives me their medical billing company's phone number, apologizes, and says she has ""not heard positive things"" about them. Great.

So I call the medical billing office explaining that their buddy, the urgent care center, sent me to them with my qualms about this phantom $200 medical bill. She looked me up by my name and birthday, and said that yes, they did send that amount to Stanislaus Credit Control Agency after four unsuccessful attempts to contact me. Interestingly enough, the main offices for both Stanislaus and this medical billing company are both located in Modesto, CA. Anyway, the lady says this is a result of me not reaching my insurance deductible, and that this $200 was the amount my insurance, Aetna, would not cover for the urgent care visit. I thought that sounded legitimate so I eased my tone and said thanks for clearing that up.

However, I now believe she was giving me a pre-scripted run-around. I call Aetna to ask what my deductible would be for an urgent care visit. **Aetna says there is no deductible for urgent care visits, only a copay.** I ask them to look up the claim for this urgent care visit, as the urgent care center has my Aetna insurance policy on file. **Aetna has no record of any claim for any urgent care center on my behalf.** 

My Aetna customer service guy says hold on, he will personally call this medical billing office. I stay on the line listening to the provided elevator music, and he comes back reporting that the person who is in control of my account is apparently not in the office today, a Monday afternoon at 2pm. I ask my Aetna customer service guy if he thinks that sounds shady. He agrees, and says he personally will try again tomorrow and get back to me. I google the urgent care center on Google, and there are already four negative reviews mentioning surprise letters from collections agencies.

Are any/all of these companies in cahoots with each other to make money from collections, instead of correctly filing a claim with Aetna? I am still waiting to hear back, as this Nancy Drew stuff all went down today. Thanks in advance for any theories.",0
"Purchased a home with a foundation issue. The seller was less than honest in disclosures.. Hi all, I'll try and keep it short and to the point, but happy to give more details if needed. 

Basically I purchased a home this last month. Leading up to the purchase everything was going well except for one issue with the foundation (crawl space).


The seller disclosed on the listing that water gets into the crawl space during ""heavy rains"". During the inspection we noted vast pools of standing water which were flagged as a ""Must fix"". We requested that an inspection be done by a very reputable company that I will refer to as Company 1. 


Scheduling complications meant that Company 1 would not be able to complete an inspection in the near future, but we found two other companies with no reason to question their credentials. Both companies surveyed the crawl space and presented identical proposals for sump pumps at a cost of $4000. 


The seller was willing to concede the $4000 so we moved forward with closing with a plan to get the crawl space repaired with those funds.  




Fast forward to this week. I had scheduled an inspector from Company 1 to come out and inspect the crawl space. I figured I might as well get the best in the business perform the work. When the inspector arrived I was shocked to learn that he already had a quote and inspection report on file for my home. Come to find out that the previous owner had in fact already had Company 1 inspect the crawl space last April. When they visited last year they measured dangerous humidity levels in the crawlspace and informed the owner that sump pumps would not fix the issue. The only remedy is to waterproof the crawlspace and the proposal for that project? $17,000. 


The inspector shared with me dozens of photographs and readings of humidity and moisture in the crawl space. The moisture is in the wood and well above safe levels for lumber framing. The inspector claims that sump pumps will remove the water, but that the real danger is humidity leading to mold and damage to the hardwood floors inside. He also says that the lack of insulation means that the floors will be ice cold in the winter. Turns out that the previous owner had also complained about that issue to Company 1. They have all of this documented with her name and address.


So my question is how screwed am I?



I shared the information with my agent who is livid on my behalf and will be seeking legal advice this week but I'm curious about anyone with experience with disclosure issues. I am assuming that I have no legal recourse against the seller because at the end of the day I signed off on the bad proposal and concession. But the seller blatantly suppressed information regarding an inspection of the crawlspace and safety issues brought to her attention. She even claimed that she had no idea that water in a crawlspace is a hazard. Did she have any legal obligation to share that information with me?


Thank you so much for any information, advice, or feedback!",1
"[US(/Japan?)] Film Contest Rights/IP Grab Fine Print?. Hi folks,

I was excited to see that Ryuichi Sakamoto is having a short film contest where you make a short film that utilizes songs from his new album, and three winners get money, compositions to use in future films, filmmaking advisor services, a spot on the blu-ray version of the album, among other things.

But in the submission guidelines, there is this bullet point:

&gt;Upon sending an email submission as noted above in step 3 of &lt;How to Submit&gt;, the applicant agrees to grant our Company, any affiliates, subsidiaries, and any third party affiliates designated by our Company and their successors a full, global, nonexclusive, irrevocable, sub-licensable, and free license to use the submitted work in any media form for any purpose. **Our Company, any affiliates, subsidiaries, and any third party affiliates designated by our Company and their successors may copy, distribute, display, publish, adapt, transmit, demonstrate, create derivative work, and use the submitted work in anyway at their sole discretion.** Furthermore, upon sending an email submission as noted above in step 3 of &lt;How to Submit&gt;, the applicant agrees to grant our Company and any affiliates, subsidiaries, any other third party designated by our Company and their successors a full, global, nonexclusive, irrevocable, sub-licensable, and free license to use the name(s), nick name(s), and biography of the filmmaker in any media form for any purpose. Our Company, affiliates, subsidiaries, any other third party designated by our Company and their successors may copy, distribute, display, publish, transmit, and use the submitted work in anyway at their sole discretion. The intended use includes but is not limited to the uploading to various websites and social media channels including Ryuichi Sakamoto’s official website, his social media channels, the official website and YouTube/Vimeo channels of the Japanese label commmons and the official website and YouTube/Vimeo channels of the international label Milan Records, in addition to the promotional use of the short film for async and as a preview for the documentary film, “Ryuichi Sakamoto Documentary Project” (tentative title).  The filmmaker must represent and warrant the lack of a third party contract which may interfere with the licensed rights above.

Is this (especially what I bolded) as sinister as it sounds? A mere submission means that a third party can create derivative work based on submitted work? ""Sorry, you lost, so we don't have to pay you, but we can spin your idea into a feature film or music video of our own production at any time.""

Am I misreading this and it's actually standard? Or it's standard anyway? Or it's an overzealous lawyer just covering themselves in case someone wins and then sees a better offer elsewhere? Er, covering themselves in case they happen to make something similar to a generic submission in the future so no one can try to pull a Creed situation?

"[Virginia] Am I in a position to seek a protective order?. I am considering attempting to get a protective order against my ex-boyfriend, but he is not an immediate threat.

This last April, he began to contact me after several months (August 2016-April 2017) of not speaking. We attempted to be friends, but our situation was not pleasant. He revealed to me during our time together in April 2017 that he had created a private Twitter account where he consistently had been posting about me for the last seven or so months. These posts contained explicit sexual details (both fantasy and real), photos of me, and specifically referred to me by name in the posts. I requested he remove the page, but he did not (as of 7/8/17, the account has been removed). 

Later in April 2017, we had engaged in a hook-up. As he drove me home (I was intoxicated and he was not- he provided the alcohol in his home), he drove past the exit to my home and instead took me to an empty street where he proceeded to assault me (choking and gagging which was intended to be sexual- I told him during the assault that I was too drunk and scared to consent, nor did I want to, but he did not stop). Later, I confronted him about it and he apologized. My therapist at the time recommended going to the police, but I was afraid to do so and didn't.

We do not talk now but he continues to post and speak about me on social media sites and to mutual friends. On the Fourth of July, he had a mutual friend text me photos of him during a party, despite the fact that I have him blocked on my social media. I messaged him yesterday for the first time since May 2017 to tell him to stop posting and talking about me, as well as to stop attempting to contact me through friends. He told me that he would not stop and that I could not make him ""forget me"".

I recognize that the online behavior is not illegal, but it feels very intentionally intimidating, as I fear him posting slanderous or sexual things about me. I am not comfortable with him still having photos of me, knowing that he has posted them in the past without my knowledge. I also feel as though he will find any means through which to try and contact me, despite me making it abundantly clear that I do not want him to. His assault against me is the primary legal issue, but since I did not take action at the time to contact authorities, I fear it is now too late. I do have texts from him admitting to the assault. Rather than attempting to bring him to court for the assault, I am interested in a protective order so that he cannot contact me, nor make me feel like I do not have any sort of privacy. I do not know if protective orders can prevent a person from posting about someone on social media, but ideally the order would stop him from doing so. 

I do not fear for my safety as he has not attempted to come to my house.

Does my particular case warrant seeking a protective order? If not, is there anything I can do to stop him from posting things about me online and attempting to contact me through friends or social media?",0
"Being evicted in the middle of a divorce. Some fairly unique (maybe?) circumstances. Hi, r/legaladvice

I'm at work and on mobile so forgive any issues formatting and I'm also going to try to keep this as short as possible.

Back story: Wife and I together 5 years, only married for 3 months before we separated. She moved out because she had been seeing someone behind my back for a while, fell in love with him and moved in with him.

Prior to that I worked. When she took a new, much higher paying job that also allowed her to be home more (but on call) her hours changed and was unable to keep her kids (2 boys from previous marriage) as often as she liked. She asked me to leave my low-ish paying job so we didn't have to deviate from the kids' schedule they'd had for years. I reluctantly agreed, but did and hadn't worked in about a year. 

Fast forward to us getting married then her shortly moving out abruptly. This left me with the rental lease on our home (though the lease is in both our names) and forced to somehow come up with rent money with no job on a home I could not afford by myself.

I quickly went back to work but making roughly $1600/month and paying almost $900 in rent + utilities just wasn't happening. Her and I agreed I would move out by the end of July, splitting the rent until then, and then she would move back in with new boyfriend. Fine whatever as far as I was concerned.

I have been doing my best to save up money to move while sharing rent and utilities with her for 3 months, but it's not easy to save up the roughly $1500 I need to move on my security salary.

I told her this last month and she agreed (in text message, I still have) that she would pay rent for July and August and I would be out by the end of August. Last week my landlord came by saying rent has not bee paid and she called him saying she was not going to pay it. She had changed her mind.

Now my landlord has filed eviction on me, and my court date is the 26th of this month. I do not have the money I need to move out by then, and no friends or family to stay with. My mother lives an hour away in a retirement home and cannot have overnight visitors.

My question is, assuming I'm not out by my court date of the 26th, how long do I have to be out before my landlord can start removing my belongings and lock me out? Do I have any legal protection at all considering the circumstances? 

I also would like to add - and this is speculation - that I have very good reason to believe that my landlord and my ex are working together on this. He is not responding to text or phone calls from me, nor is she. I know good and well she wants to move back into our home with her new dude because he has kids, plus her and her kids and it's my understanding that his two bedroom is just too small, whereas I have 4 rooms. The landlord has had a ""thing"" for my ex for sometime and their families are close knit. He was always very rude with me and her and I used to both joke it's because he's jealous of me.

Thank you in advance for any help.

"[Boston MA] Landlord has signed a lease with a new tenant starting three weeks before our agreed move-out date.. This is in Boston, MA.  I signed a one-year lease at my current apartment on September 1, 2012.  At the end of the year, I asked my landlord how he wanted to renew my lease, and he informed me that unless I specified that I wasn't renewing with two months notice, that he auto-renewed the lease for another year, and that he didn't need me to sign another lease.  Every year since in June I have let him know in writing that I was renewing my lease for another year, and asked if there were any changes to the lease he needed me to sign for.  He'd never respond, and wait until mid-August to let me know that my rent was going up.  So basically the only singed paperwork I have from him expired in 2013, and we had verbal agreements to one year extensions up until now.  He is also notorious for skimming emails and his low reading comprehension skills have led to some interesting confusion in the past.

This year, my girlfriend and I decided to move in together.  Because her lease ended earlier than mine, we singed a lease on a new apartment starting July 1.  However, we decided that I should move in in August to make things a little less hectic.  When I asked my landlord for a reference, I clearly stated that despite my new lease starting a month early, I was planning on staying through the end of my current lease at the end of August, but that I was willing to move a little out earlier if he wanted me to.  I scheduled movers to come on August 5, and emailed my landlord that that was my move-out date, and told him in person when I saw him the next day.  A week later in early June, my landlord listed my apartment on Craigslist as available on August 1.  I sent my landlord two e-mails reminding him that we had agreed I would not be moving out of my apartment until August 5.  He replied saying that he had a tenant lined up for an August 15 move-in.  I confirmed this with him verbally the next day. 

I heard nothing else about my move for a month, until today when he emailed me to schedule the move-out inspection because he needed the apartment ready by 7/14.  I haven't even started packing yet as I assumed I had another month and I was helping my girlfriend pack her stuff.  There is no way I can have my stuff out of here in four days.

My question is, if my landlord did in fact sign a lease with a new tenant starting July 15, where does that leave me? I only have a verbal agreement for my current lease.  My landlord has stated that he treats them as one-year extensions, but legally I wouldn't be surprised if it was considered month-to-month. I notified my landlord five times that I was moving out in the beginning of August, three times in writing.  I also have his written agreement that he was leasing the apartment for August 15, and well as a verbal agreement.  I double checked his email, and he spelled out the date as August 15 instead of 8/15.  Can he really give me four days notice that his last communication with me was a typo?",1
"[CA] CPS worker showing obvious favoritism to abusive parent, refusing to return any calls/emails. Anyone I can appeal to?. Hi Reddit,

Sorry if this is lengthily there is a lot of background info. I live with my boyfriend and he has a 5yr old from a previous relationship. Last September it was discovered that the bio-mom's boyfriend was beating up the son and the mom was aware of it and also admitted to being complacent in the abuse. The DA refused to press charges saying that these cases are hard to get a convection on. The son was taken away from his mother and my boyfriend had sole physical custody for a period of two months. Then CPS agreed that the mother should get visitation rights and set out other guidelines she needed to follow. Note my boyfriend still has full legal custody.

The mother was told she had to attend parenting classes, attend personal therapy. That the cps agent would be doing monthly home inspections. She still lives with her parents, and that cps would meet with her once a month to check in. They went to court in February and the mother had done nothing. CPS recommended giving my boyfriend sole physical custody and determined she was an unfit mother. The court overruled that and gave her an extension to start the program. My boyfriend was obviously upset and tried to appeal but CPS told him they would follow up and ensure she was doing the things and that there would be home visits.

Since the last court date there is a new CPS worker and she is terrible. The son disclosed to my boyfriend that his mom was still dating his abuser and my boyfriend reported that to cps since it was violating court orders. CPS worker said there was no way to confirm it. A couple weeks ago when I was babysitting the boy he told me how if he doesn't listen his mom will hit him and that his grandpa beats him with a wooden spoon if he doesn't listen. I told this to cps &amp; put her supervisor on the email and never got a response. Also almost fot the whole month of June the mother refused to pick up her son at the scheduled times: while we obviously didn't mind the extra time my boyfriend had his lawyer file a complaint so it would be on the record. In response to this the CPS worker told my boyfriend he needs to take co-parenting classes to learn how to negotiate with his ex better. 

They go to court in two weeks for another check in and today his ex sent him part of an email exchange she had with the worker asking some questions but the earlier part of the exchange is the worker and his ex talking about her getting more custody and some tax stuff which is not even in CPS' jurisdiction. 

My boyfriend and I are very upset about this, not just that his son could end up spending more time with an abusive parent but simple because the worker has been in communication with the mom while ignoring any communication we've had. So my question is is there someone else to bring this up with outside if cps? Or should we have the lawyer bring it up in court? Also neither of us has dealt with CPS before so is there a way to appeal
A decision from them?

"Can I sue a church (Mormon) to recover my donations [Utah, USA]?. TLDR; The Mormon church uses deceptive, dishonest, and manipulative tactics to convince people to join the church and solicit donations.  Can the church be sued (possibly for fraud) to recover donations.

First of all, I realize that this is a complete long shot and probably not feasible given the protections religions enjoy in the U.S.  However, if a company in the U.S. convinces consumers to purchase its products by significantly misrepresenting those products, the company could be guilty of fraud and held responsible accordingly.  I see a corollary with the Mormon church in that it has consistently misled its members about key aspects of the religion which affect the ability of members to make an informed decision on whether or not to donate to the church.  Also, to be clear, these donations are considered obligatory by the Mormon church, the minimum acceptable amount is 10% of income, and members are told that they must pay these donations (tithing) before they pay for rent or even food for their children.  The consequence for not paying tithing is that members cannot go to the temple, which means that they cannot go to super awesome Mormon heaven (Celestial Kingdom) and therefore cannot be with their families after they die.

Some of the things not taught by Mormon church leaders in the past and generally disparaged as anti-Mormon lies include the facts that 1) Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon by staring at a rock in a hat, 2) Joseph Smith married other men's wives and teenage girls as young as fourteen, 3) Joseph Smith completely botched the translation of an Egyptian papyrus when writing the Book of Abraham, 4) Joseph Smith told contradictory versions of his First Vision experience, 5) Joseph Smith was incarcerated legitimately based on violations of the law (the church teaches that Joseph Smith was arrested on ""trumped up charges"", 6) Polygamy continued to be practiced even after the church publicly declared that it had ceased to practice polygamy, etc.  

The list could continue for quite a while, but the point I want to make is that the church has been very dishonest with members in the past.  Additionally, missionaries provide partial and misinformation to investigators so that they will join the church without understanding it.  As a result, many people joined the church and many members paid tithing who would not have otherwise done so if they were fully informed about the church.  In my mind, this constitutes fraud and it seems like the church's victims should be eligible for restitution.

Incidentally, after many decades of trying to cover up the truth, the Mormon church published some essays a couple years ago that acknowledged the six points listed above as well as other issues (www.mormonessays.com).  Consequently, it is quite simple to demonstrate dishonesty and duplicity by church leaders in the past because they deny the very things acknowledged in the essays. 

Given the above information, is there any legal angle that might be reasonably successful in the recovery of donations to the Mormon church?",0
"(USA-MA)Traffic Ticket Law, 3 Charges/$515, is a lawyer worth it? + General Advice please.. I would like to state that I am appealing this ticket with or without a lawyer, and I am asking for advice on my best course of action.

There was a crazy amount of traffic where I had to drive today.  There was the usual Tourist traffic for people heading down to the cape, alongside the typical traffic, and also a funeral procession clogging things up.

I was in a position where to travel at a safe speed of 75 mph (speed limit is 65mph, but the average travelling speed is between 70-80mph) I had to change lanes frequently.  My goal was to get around the funeral procession travelling at 65 mph in the middle lane, and to not get trapped behind the individuals travelling 70mph in both the left and middle lane (the person in the right hand lane was not passing, and was in fact slowing down for some reason).  I had to change lanes numerous times, but did so using my turn indicator and while paying attention to where my vehicle was.

I observed a state trooper fly up the highway with damage to his driver's side front end.  I was currently in the right hand lane, to the right of the two cars travelling at 70 mph.  He had his lights on, and as I pulled over he pulled over VERY close, and I pulled forward another foot or so to avoid being struck.

I pull out my licence, wait for the cop.  He reaches in and takes it without a word from either of us.  He comes back and hands me the ticket without saying anything else, he was positioned in a way where it was hard for me to look at him or see anything.  I say thank you, he gets in his vehicle and leaves, with me stuck in the breakdown lane in heavy traffic for 2 miles.

Tl;dr I was trying to get around really slow and distracted drivers, did so in a way that was a bit rushed, and a state trooper who was obviously having a bad day gave me a ticket without so much as a 'Do you know why I pulled you over?'

-----
The ticket states...

89-4A Weaving x6 $105

89-4A Unsafe Lane Change x3 $105

90/17 95 in a 65 with no boxes checked (Posted, Not Posted, Clocked, Lidar, Radar, Estimated)

I know 100% that I wasn't travelling at 95 miles per hour.  I was at most 80-85, and only so I could pass the traffic that was inconsistently between 60-75.

I do not have the best record, I had a similar ticket 4 years ago (which is the last spot on my record, which goes away in 5 months).  With that said, my record has been improving over time.

My question here is, is a traffic lawyer going to do me any favors, or is it not worth the time?  I was quoted $700 flat from a lawyer earlier today, which would make sense long-term if this entire ticket gets dismissed, but I am not sure if that would even happen.

How much more likely is the case going to be dismissed/reduced with a lawyer present than if I represented myself?  I am capable of looking up laws, cleaning up my appearance, and get to the court on time.  With the information above, if you can offer any insight it would be appreciated.  I have never been to court before (no criminal record, never fought a ticket) and want to do my best.",0
"[Canada, BC] Being threatened to be sued by former ""employer"". I'll try to make this short.

About a year ago, I, a minor, signed an NDA with an online tech startup based out of California. I cosigned with my parent(s) to do so. I signed my NDA under the presumption that I would be doing work, and getting paid for said work; where the latter was false. It worked out swell for a few months, but my boss started to miss paychecks -- skipping entire months of pay saying that I didn't deserve it because I was ""useless"" and so on. Just a few days ago, a direct competitor offered me a job with them and I decided that I was done with the B.S. that my boss was throwing at me, so I put in my two weeks notice saying that I was going to explore my options at other companies. Instead of working my two weeks, my access was fully removed across all platforms and he told me that in no uncertain terms, he would be suing me if I were to join a competitor. As for what, specifically, he has eluded to the doctrine of ""inevitable disclosure"". Now, I've done my fair share of homework, and there are no clauses in my NDA that prevent me from leaving him and joining a competitor. There are clauses that refer to him being able to apply for an injunction to stop me from revealing his CI in whole or in part, but that's only under the presumption that I have revealed his CI or have threatened to reveal it (which I have done neither).

I've been talking to my parents, and they think that he, for lack of a better way to say it, can't do anything. I'm not joining the competitor to reveal his CI, I'm joining the competitor because they treat me better and pay me more. I never signed a working agreement or contract with him, and it's safe to say that the entirety of the pay that I earned with him was under-the-table. Whenever I alluded to me being his employee (prior this entire ordeal), he'd be very quick to remind me that I am in fact only an 'independent contractor', and not his employee. I don't know if that's relevant to this question, but I thought it may be.

So my question, to you, is the following: What are my options? I have several offers from competitors, offers that I very much want to take, but he's saying if I take any of them w/out his prior written approval (exemption in writing), he'll file suit. Keep in mind, I am a minor from Canada, and he is an adult from California. I am afraid that if I take an offer from a competitor, he will file suit and I'll have to deal with that accordingly. He does have my address, so he can serve me papers (excuse my naivety for the legal process, I'm by no means an expert). My parents think that I am fine, and I can take an offer from the competitor. They've also said (paraphrasing): ""what is he going to do? Extradite you?"", in response to my fears of being sued. They think that if he files suit, I can simply ignore it and let it drift in the water, because what can he do? I'm a minor from Canada, and I haven't even broken his agreement.

Sorry if this post got a little long. I hope I included all relevant details. If you have any questions that I can clarify/expound upon please don't hesitate to ask.",0
"Friends and I paid a deposit on a rental home, did not sign contract, price quote keeps raising within the month of paying the deposit (Michigan). This is my first time having to deal with renting, but my roommates have rented several times before. We are all going to grad school (my first year, their last year). We have assistantships that give us a paycheck each month. There is a mobile home park across the street from school, and they have great sized homes for what we need - three bedrooms, two full baths, a washer/dryer, dishwasher, central air, etc. It's a pretty great deal.

When we were originally looking, the price range (depending on size and age of the unit) was $879-$929. We put in an application and got accepted, and **at that point paid the $200 deposit**. We called to inquire about a moving date, got told mid-July or end of for moving in, and was alerted that the prices were being raised by corporate and it was now $959-$979. They told us the unit we have was $979 a month...but it wasn't a new unit.

Okay, kind of crappy, but we all estimated highly for rent just to be on the safe side. My other roommates have been heading talking to them, I was just ""added in"" to the contract. According to my roommates, they have been rude. After inquiring about why we are getting a higher price, they were snippy and explained it was corporate and not them.

Fast forward to yesterday, they told us rent is possibly being raised to $999 a month, which is completely absurd. The manager told us she would ""go to bat"" for us to keep the $979 rate after my roommates absolutely blew up her phone and e-mail. She then complained to my roommates that it was only $6 extra per person so she doesn't understand why it was such a big deal. We are paid pennies in grad school, we can't afford a lot in rent especially since we have to pay other utilities here as well as fees and that's not including food and gas. She then proceeded to say that we should be grateful we are getting a spot with such a good deal and so close to the school with so many utilities covered (we have to pay electricity, gas, and internet.) That's a lie, a few other places cover almost all utilities but they have no availability and if we bring it up they'll just drop the contract and tell us to go there instead.

Something about this seems very wrong, it doesn't sit right. I understand that corporate could be raising prices, but isn't it a thing that the price is locked in after paying the deposit? We are paying the rest right before we move in, **as well as signing the contract (we have not done that yet.)** We also have to determine a moving date, we don't know when that is either. We know complexes and parks near schools extort students, especially right across the street from the school, and that is a reason why the price is so high. But it's too late to find something else, I am also scared that if we keep fighting they will take away our contract and we will be homeless.

Since we have not signed the contract, is there anything we can do? I have this impending feeling they will raise the price and continue doing so until I literally will not have any extra money.",1
"[CA] Ex-boyfriend has been harassing me for years, has now begun harassing my fiancee (X-Post /r/Relationships). I posted this originally in /r/relationships and was told I should speak to the police and/or an attorney about a restraining order. I wanted to post here and make sure taking these steps would be worth my time. Here's the situation:

I dated my ex-boyfriend my first semester at university (7.5 years ago). We dated casually (I was seeing other people) for about 6 months, and then he asked for us to be exclusive. I met his parents shortly after when they came to visit him at the university over the summer. My parents were also visting at the time, and they all seemed to hit it off, even exchanging contact information so my dad and his could go golfing sometime (which I'm sure was just my father being curteous, but I digress).


The following semester, my ex-boyfriend started to show his true colors. He began yelling at my both in public and private if I cursed, dressed provocatively (wearing shorts or a tank top), or if he felt I was disrespecting him. I ended the relationship shortly after. This is when his harassment started.


My ex-boyfriend would text and call me and my best friend non stop about why I left him and how he was going to kill himself. I ignored this, I knew he was just being manipulative. He started accusing my best friend of ""stealing"" me from him and turning me into a lesbian. We continued to ignore this crazy train and eventually it slowed down.


When I went home at Christmas to visit my parents I learned that my ex boyfriends FATHER had been calling my dad about the break up. He said his son had bought an engagement ring and we owed their family for the expense. My dad just laughed it off, thankfully. Nothing ever came of this.


Fast forward to now. My ex-boyfriend hasn't done much for the past two or three years to me. But my current partner and I just got engaged and my ex-boyfriend found out (I'm guessing via social media?). My partner was faculty at the university I attended. We started seeing each other at some point while I was still a student. He has since left the university and obviously I graduated. A few people knew about our relationship and ignored it; we were in different colleges and were never public about our relationship. But my ex-boyfriend has now begun harassing him on social media and even got his office phone number and is threatening to ""out"" us to all of my partner's colleagues. I don't think anything would come of it, albeit some embarrassment, but the bigger problem is that this guy is still obsessed.


I have no idea how to get this guy to stop. I've tried blocking him, obviously he's still vindictive as ever. I feel like I'm trapped in a teenage drama. I'm not a child anymore and I want this all to stop. But I'm scared to talk to him either over the phone, via email or face to face for fear of inflaming this issue even further. 

Also, in case this is of relevance: I currently live in California and the guy harassing me resides in Georgia. 


TL;DR my crazy ex-boyfriend won't let things go 5 years later. No idea how to get him to stop. Not sure if I need to seek legal council.",0
"(North Carolina)I made concessions to please potential tenants they won't sign or pay. Hindsight is 20/20. I realize now my mistakes:
Holding rental property with out deposit or signed lease or any money what so ever.

The wife of the couple 23f and 23 m military put me on the spot several times. 


Things I've tried to graciously provide but is turning and in fact turned into a nitpicking negotiating, bulldozing nightmare.

""Reduce the pet fee since one pet is emotional therapy but will not prove it""

""Let us paint (before even seeing the house it's recently been professionally painted for 2k)""

""Let us meet you in the middle of the night, give us directions for an hour, invite all our friends and bang on the door,oh we forgot the money, we didn't bring the signed lease, we couldn't find a printer, we don't want to sign the lease until we pay and didn't want to pay until we found out your a real person not a craigslist killer""

Everything screams (I'm an idiot me the op and they are entitled)

They've been in the house since 1am Saturday, can't get them to answer to meet up for the lease and payment, they promised they would but like everything else they just end up doing what they want.

When I called this evening they finally answered and instead of giving me a time to meet they say ""we don't wanna pay the full month and want you to take off money from the deposit we have a list of discrepancies, and instead of 865 we want to pay 500""

I explained I already did the walk through with them every appliance is new, we did not provide a washer and had warned them that, now that is a bargaining chip for them.

I saw the writing on the wall and said 
""You've not paid any money you've not signed a lease and you've not stopped making demands-it's clear I'm not going to make you happy this isn't working""

He says ""I need a week"" but also cusses me out and threatens me that they haven't signed anything so he doesn't have to do ""jack S----""

I say ""please no hard feelings but this will never work you've not jumped through any of the hoops that tenants are supposed to and I've had to do every single thing what your asking me to do now is too much special treatment""

The house could pass a military inspection it was spotless ontop and behind appliances professionally cleaned. 

They are not in the same reality... I know really shouldn't have let them move their stuff in but they were ""please don't make us get a storage unit tonight just for one night"" and he is a marine who just got back the beginning of the month, I didn't know things would get so out of hand but they kept pushing.

I ended the conversation by saying I might be able to give you 48 hour but I need you guys out because I really did hold the house for you and this has gotten out of hand, your not wanting to pay and your taking advantage of me (my stupidity in reality).

What do I do?
I need to know my rights, I am getting a property manager but I would like to get them out since they have no intention of really paying and keep stalling.

I have his commands number but I do not know legally if they are squatters or what I have done. We only want them gone with out retaliating in the form of damage.",1
"[CA] Lateral transfer to lower position after reporting workplace harassment. Hi legaladvice, I'm going to attempt to describe my issue in the best detail possible. 

In March of this year, I was verbally assaulted by a co-worker that I used to be friendly with. He did not agree with a life decision I made (I did not know this information until months later) and developed a very deep hatred for me. Behind my back, he would stalk my workload and attempt to find errors and immediately report it to management/After two weeks of condescending remarks about my work, I confronted him as to why he was acting this way, to which he called me a ""fuck up"", ""ruining the company"", ""make mistakes every day"", ""I tell everyone that you fuck up"". I remained quiet and refused to engage in any sort of retaliation. After this incident, management had separate meeting with myself and the harasser, to which they claimed it was resolved. After this meeting, my supervisor stopped speaking to me and only initiated contact unless absolutely necessary. I was effectively ostracized. 

Instead of attacking me to my face, the harasser then decided to make it a point to talk badly about me to all of my workers on a daily basis. He continued to stalk my work and made it his mission to get me fired. The workplace became incredibly hostile, and any projects in my department that I needed assistance on, he refused to help with outright. This was affecting business and made my workload greater. I once again reported the harassment and hostility to management, (who claimed we ""Have no HR"") and they once again had a meeting with both, separately, to fix the issue. 

Once again, the harasser found ways to continue his assault. There was a racial joke made at my expense by another employee who motioned to the harasser in a knowing way, and he laughed uncontrollably. I reported the further harassment for the third time, to which there were no repercussions. 

The final time I reported an issue was when the harasser resorted to laughing at me every time I walked past his area to make me feel uncomfortable no matter where I was. He would do it even louder each time he walked past me as well. At this point, the company magically had an HR department in which they directed me to email. I sent my story and current issue and received no response. This morning I received a email from the Operations Manager that I was being laterally transferred (no change in pay) to a department that had far less responsibility, is considered to be beneath my current department, and simultaneously removed me for the lead position on an upcoming project. I essentially lost many of my decision-making abilities and was placed in a position where management is fully aware I do not want to be. The harasser remains in his position in my department based on his ""seniority"". 

I believe I am facing retaliation for reporting harassment, and want to know what my legal options are at this moment. From what I understand, Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from doing lateral transfers in retaliation, especially to unwanted positions that revoke responsibility (seen as a demotion without legally calling it one).",0
"Michigan, can my landlord pop up unannounced and bring people through my house without my permission? Or when I'm not home?. I'm still pretty upset. So yesterday my landlord texted me and asked if he can bring someone over for a walk through. My lease is up August 31st. We set up for 4pm because I was supposed to work but another guy wanted hours so I let him pick up my shift. About an hour ago I get a knock at the door and as I'm getting up from my bed (butt ass naked) he opens up the door and has the new tenant with him. I was so embarrassed and ran back to the room as quickly as possible. He then yelled ""we'll give you a minute!"" And laughed and his tone was like ""oh this guy is so dumb"" as soon as I opened my room door they walk in and it was so awkward. I was just cleaning as we went and kept apologizing, it wasn't filthy but embarrassing like I had my weed jar out (yes I have my med card) and underwear in the bathroom floor, plates on he counter, I was planning on doing a quick clean up before they came.

They actually got done quick and then he came back and talked to me like I was a kid telling me I need to keep the place clean and stuff. Also questioning why I told him I would be at work. I told him I don't owe him an explanation and that we had an agreed time and he got upset and was like ""ok whatever I know what we talked about"". I have texts as well so I don't know why he even went there.

This isn't the first incident though. In March I come home to him leaving my unit and he said it was a leak they found during the inspection and he came to fix it. He then said he needed to grab some tools and will be back in 30. After working a 12 hour shift I was just ready to go to bed and after about an hour I said fuck it and assumed he's not coming and feel asleep and wake up to my bedroom door opening up and him telling me he was back. He then began looking in closets and shit saying he was trying to find the leak. (But he got the tools already to fix the kitchen sink) also they found it during the inspection so what was he looking for?


This feels extremely invasive and annoying. Is there anything I can do legally? It just upsets me because I'm wondering how many times he's came when I'm not here, and he brought the girl over to view the place when I told him I would be at work. 

I've also found long blonde hairs around my place and no one with blonde hair comes over. At first I thought I was going crazy until if felt like every other day people at work were telling me I had a long hair hanging from my beard I blew it off months ago but now I'm starting to think that he may bring people over during the day, as I work mostly during the day and I work from sun up to sun down most days. 

Also I noticed its times that my living room tv would be on( I'm not even in the living room unless company is over) or I had 2 less packs of ramen. Things that are big enough that I noticed but small enough where I don't look into at all. I know I can't prove any of this, but what options do I have? I have the neighbor looking out and she told me he does similar stuff to her but with her it's just him popping up and not having stuff out of place. 

Is he within his rights?",1
"My terminally ill cousin with schizophrenia was forced out of the hospital. Her siblings are also trying to steal from her [Georgia]. Problem 1:

My cousin has cancer. It was at one point treatable, but because of her mental health issues she was not able follow the plan established by her doctors. She is now terminally ill. Last week (Wednesday, the 44th day of her stay), we were notified by the hospital  that they planned to discharge her the next day. We were generally not happy with the treatment she received there (they would forget to feed her and administer her medication), but the nursing home she came from was worse, and we had yet to find better alternatives.  The next afternoon (Thursday) they returned her to the nursing home after saying she had consented to leave. She has  schizophrenia,  has not consistently received her medication, and is unable to make these kinds of decisions. I, her power of attorney,  did not discuss her discharge with anyone at the hospital (I was unable to return their call in time), and did not consent to her return to this nursing home. After speaking with my cousin about the incident later, she denies saying she was prepared to leave. Friday, around noon, less than 24 hours after she returned to the nursing home, she was readmitted to a different hospital for breathing problems. She was diagnosed with Pneumonia, and doctors noted spots on her lungs. 

We are appalled by the way they have treated her, but aren’t sure who to contact, or what we can do about it. Should we contact the medical board? Do we need a lawyer? What kind of lawyer do we need?

Problem 2:

My cousin has siblings who so far, have not participated in her care, but seem very interested in her assets, and the possibility of acquiring them after her death (she has no children, a nice home, and over $150,000 cash). Though we haven’t mentioned it to her, she has said she suspects they are “only coming around now because they’ve figured out how much money i’ve got”.

One sibling is particularly intent on using her in any way possible. After meeting with her doctor to discuss her prognosis, his first thought was to search her house for life insurance policies. He has asked my husband and I to purchase bonds with her money, and a number of other “small” horrible things. 

This weekend we found out that he broke into her house and changed  her locks. We do not know when it happened, or if he took anything, but my cousin says she did not want him in her house, and did not ask him to change her locks. He says he did so because he needed to find her insurance policy. He doesn’t want to be responsible for her funeral expenses after she passes, and didn’t trust me (the power of attorney) or her other sister to go to her home. He claims to be trying to do what’s best for her. 

He has also been very adamant that she not return to her house (we’ve considered placing her there with an in-home nurse for her final days). We now believe it is because when he was there he stole something. 

I am not sure how to protect her property from him while she is still alive, and I am wondering if I should call the police, and seek a  restraining order.

"Pretty bad fight, what can I expect? Help?. Guys, I'm still really hurting so I don't really want to go into too much detail. I'd like to preface this by saying, I'm aware I'm most likely the one who is going to suffer with this, I'm posting here to have an idea of what I'm looking at...

Essentially (I'm going to make this as brief as possible). I've been seeing this girl for the past 6 months, but we've had a thing for about 7 or 8 years now, but between me having a gf at the time and then moving country, it was only really 6 months ago we actually ""finally connected"". Anyway, so about 3 weeks she starts going cold on me, I ask her what's up and she's says nothing. I knew straight away what was happening so I asked ""are you seeing someone else""? Like I said, its fine because we've always been on and off, no real strings attached. I admit, i'd fallen hard for her. She'd spent the last 6 months telling me she loved me and all that. But either way, I wasn't too mad/sad because I we live in different countries now and we both knew whatever we were going to have would be most likely temporary. But bare in mind, we'd been crazy for each other since we first met.

So anyway, I spend the next couple of weeks just trying to get her be honest, I didn't mind if she wanted to cut things off with me, just honesty. She eventually made a ""play"", saying that I'm being pedantic and that of course she loved me and only me etc.. so we met up, and we cuddled that night, and I just couldn't help myself. I went on her phone, I NEEDED to know. Turns out I was just her side bit. She'd been talking to her ex the whole time, and the only reason we started up again was because he'd gone cold on her and she wanted attention.

Next morning, normal stuff, she goes on her way (thinking she convinced me that play) and I obviously don't say a word. Later that night I just say ""wish you'd been honest, was nice knowing you"". Obviously I was a bit hurt, but I was also finally ""free"".

But about 2 days later, I saw her with her ex. I was in my car just going to go get some food. They were talking and having a coffee etc and I was legit fine. In a sense I was happy because they had in fact been together for quite a while (who am I to get in the way). But then he put his hand on her shoulder, and kissed her, and I just couldn't handle it.

I know this is no justification for what I did, truly, but bear in mind this guy used to beat the shit out of her. She used to send me pictures and she'd call me crying.

I stepped out of my car, completely blind, I can't even remember if I put the handbrake on, and just steamed towards him. It was all over so quick, I mean, now it just feels like some messed up dream... Her screaming begging me to stop, and I just couldn't help myself. All I could picture were the pictures she used to send me. So without getting into detail, I got into my first fight. I regret in a way now, I didn't think I could go so far....

Tl:DR; Beat the shit out of a girls abusive boyfriend, no weapons involved. Definitely broke some bones. I am not proud of it believe me, this has been one of the worst experiences of my life. I just want to know what to expect if he presses charges... 

By the way, if the story is unnecessary let me know and I'll remove it, thank you.",0
"Dad cheated, now mom is financially destroyed. Help me help her.. Hi,

I just posted to financial advice and was told to post here too. 


A little back story, my dad has fucked around on my mom, lied, cheated and hidden things in the past. My mom forgave him and he ""rededicated himself to her and god"". She loves him, and has always forgiven him, but now it's just too much.


So about three days ago my mother found evidence that my (step)father was trying to contact the woman with whom he has previously had an affair. She found the many searches for this woman’s phone number, address, social media, and so forth on his phone.


She has also found out that he has a secret credit card. It has a 6k limit with a 2.5K balance, last payment made a few weeks ago.
He has always been in charge of finances, he makes over 100K and she, a school teacher now, makes only 28K. My father has always been in charge of the household bills, finances and is basically head of household in that aspect.


My mother has been under the impression that all bills were being paid. They have not.


My mother has a nervous system disorder which landed her in the Mayo Clinic for quite some time, running tests, spinal taps and so on. Recently both were involved in a car accident together. My father has stated that all the medical bills are being taken care of, however after recently checking my mother has found that his medical bills are paid and hers are not.


When my parents met, 16 years ago, my mother was in college. He helped her pay for her doctorate in molecular biology. She went on to work for NCAR, and to publish papers. My father decided it was time for him to pursue his dream and together they moved to florida. My mother could not find any work in Florida in her field and so decided to teach instead.


I bring this up because she has around 120K in student loans, none of which have been paid, and now works in public education. She has been out of the science world for so long she fears she will never find work that will make ends meet.


She has also found out that they have a “joint IRS lean”? I'm probably saying this wrong…so basically again, my dad said he was paying the taxes, he spend a lot of time as a contracted worker, and hasn't paid taxes at all. its 17K in back owed taxes. Again, I'm not familiar with this at all.


They own a sail boat that has both their names on it. She has currently taken up residence on the boat. I have asked her to change her DL and mailing address to the boat.


They do not own a home.


One paid off Explorer, maybe worth 5K


Her Mini Cooper is in my father’s name, not paid for. 17K owed.


Her credit score is now screwed because he has not paid anything in her name. Its maybe in the 400’s She really scared and wont talk with me at length about it.


28K a year.


120K in student debt.


5K in retirement in her name


Father has 401 K unknown amount


around 3K medical debt.


Terrible credit.


Not sure if she can afford a lawyer.


ANY advice would be so helpful. I love my mom, and she doesn't deserve this. I love my pops too…but right now I’m angry and he shouldn't be allowed to get away with this.

 Contested divorce in state of florida runs 5-20 thousand, which she doesn't have.
She does not qualify for legal aid, she has informed me.",0
"FedEx Truck physically forced me off the road damaging my car and fled. Got it on Dash Cam. FedEx corporate is now being shady, dragging the ordeal out, and deleting evidence I send them.. A couple months ago in U.S. Georgia I was traveling on the interstate and a FedEx Semi with two modules forced me out of my lane. Dude literally pushed me and my two year old out of the lane. Tried to flag him down and he just carried on. Ok, that's cool, lucky me I have a dash cam. Call the cops, about two minutes in the call we cross state lines into Alabama. Another fifteen minutes later dispatch advises me to just pull over (I was still following the truck) and wait for a state trooper.

State trooper shows up looks at the footage and tells me he wishes that dispatch wouldn't have told me to pull over because that truck is long gone by now and the driver needed a ""talking to"". He also said I would have to fill out a SR-13 form because since this happened in GA and he fled into AL that the police report would have to have been filed in GA (I later found out that a SR-13 is by no means a police report and more of a civilian witness report). So I thank him, and get back on the road.

The next day I contacted FedEx and a few days after that I was being transferred between a couple different people. I finally got connected with a regional manager who said he would look into it for me. About a week passes, I email him for an update, He responds saying they're still looking for the driver (Note: I've already given them Licence# and Truck# including a pic from the dashcam). He says he'll contact me inside of two days. Another week passes. I email again, he says they're still looking, and I inform him that I really don't care who the driver is that I just want my car fixed. Two more weeks pass of them giving me excuses and I call them out saying it's been over a month. Magically they find out the location of the driver and connect me with his manager. I catch the manager up with the story over the next few days. He asks to see the video. I tell him I can upload it to a google drive and give him access. He says that's fine. I tell him to give me a week to get the video from a backup drive out of state (I was in the process of moving the week he asked) and to let me edit it to a reasonable size and I'll upload it. A week goes by and I upload it.

Now this is where it gets really shady.
Get an email from him a few days later, in short it reads ""Hey, Having a problem opening the video, can you send it on a flash drive?"". I reply ""Sure, In the meantime can you explain why you can't see the video and I'll try to fix it on my end"". Well I get home and check the google drive...low and behold in the drive history I can see where the mother fucker deleted the files and then restricted his own access to view only. I sent an email asking why he did this and reuploaded everything in every imaginable format so he can't use that excuse again. I guess he assumed I didn't have another backup and wanted to hide the evidence and sweep this under the rug.

So is this lawyer time? Do I need to go ahead and report it to my insurance? (I told FedEx I'd let them fix it without getting Insurance involved, but that is about to go out the window). I have everything documented but I don't know what my next step needs to be. Thanks!",0
"[Ohio] Software side project gone bad, client demanding money paid to me as a 1099 employee be returned in full or lawyers will be involved.     As a naive recent college graduate, I came upon an opportunity to work on a side project for a small business owner. We agreed that it would be a side project and I had to get permission from my full-time boss before I could take the project on (proactively avoid any conflict of interests situation). 




    My boss said he thought it wasn't the best idea because he didn't want my focus being pulled away from any client I would be working for at my full time job, but ultimately was okay with me doing the side project (with the caveat of no phone calls for side project while at a client site, and my full time job always comes first). I communicated this situation to the small business owner and he was okay with the situation.




    Long story short, I completely underestimated the project (right out of college, estimation abilities weren't based on reality) and had to enlist the help of 3 other acquaintances to help. We all were working on the project on and off for over a year and there was still some minor development work to be completed plus user testing/bug fixes at the time of him deciding to call off the project.




    Over the course of the year he paid me two payments of equal amount and he paid me as a 1099 employee (the second payment only for the sake of being able to include it in his 2016 taxes). From the first payment I used almost all of it to pay 3 work friends for their help. Almost half of the second payment ended up going towards paying my own taxes from the 1099 income.




    At the end of 2016/beginning of  2017 his business took a huge hit after losing a major client, and he had to downsize to the point where he might be quitting altogether/finding some other opportunity. In the stress of his business falling apart all of the sudden, he burned a lot of bridges and took a lot of his stresses out on others. During this time he told me that we were going to have to scrap the project because he no longer really had a use for it.




    Now, about a month later, he calls me and basically says that he doesn't have a finished product to show for his money and he wants it all back, even if we have to come up with a monthly payment plan. I brought up my time and energy spent on the project and he basically told me that my time doesn't matter, I was supposed to give him this product and I didn't so I owe him everything back. I even told him how half what he paid me had gone to outside help for his project, a large portion to taxes, and I only had a small portion left to show for my own efforts and time; to which he basically replied that that was on me and that my time and efforts are worthless and that if I didn't pay him back he would have no choice but to get his lawyer(s) involved.


So, r/legaladvice, am I pretty much screwed in this situation, or would I even stand any kind of chance in court? He decided to give up on the project and he paid me as a 1099 employee, does that matter in this kind of scenario? I know he is trying to recoup from losses in his business, but just because my efforts are less tangible in his mind (lines of code), it shouldn't discredit my hundreds of hours of effort.

Any help or advice would be appreciated!",0
"Should my LLC, a small subcontracting company, declare bankruptcy?. I'll preface this by pointing out that I have not yet spoken to a bankruptcy lawyer or an accountant about this, and am just looking for some direction about my next step before I commit to spending anything more.  I'll post a TL;DR at the end.

I am a carpenter with 15 years experience who decided 2.5 years ago to start up my own small contracting company.  The way I saw it, business in my area was really picking up and I had a solid small group of skilled guys willing to work with me to build something new.  I also had my father, himself a contractor since before I was born, giving me advice and even providing startup cash.  It seemed like a great idea at the time and I did make some food money for a while.

Fast forward to about 8 months ago.  My wife was pregnant with our first and after a couple of bad rental homes (one infested with bedbugs) I had an opportunity to buy a foreclosure at a ridiculously low price that needed some work.  At the time the company was between jobs, but I had about 35k in the bank for starting cash on my next contract due to start in January.  Now, I should add that I never took any accounting courses in college and that for the first year I had my father's office manager doing my books part time until things got so busy she couldn't anymore and I had to switch to quickbooks and manage it myself.  After getting nailed on taxes the year before for having made about 40k in pure profit over the year I decided on December 31st to take out the down payment for my house in the form of a bonus, the gross of which equalled about 30k.  What i did not realize, since I had never before run into any issue with cashflow, was that my payroll tax was not withdrawn until the end of the quarter, so I had not included it when I figured how much to withdraw.  

Anyways, I ended up very short when it came time to pay the tax and I now owe the IRS about 17k.  To make matters worse, that contract ended up being a huge loser, and I can't even be sure I will be able to pay my suppliers and subcontractors when it is all said and done.  I project coming up about 2k short after getting the retainage at closeout, and then I still owe the IRS 17k.  So at 19k in debt (at best, it's probably more) and no cash and no future contracts (I stopped bidding when my crew of guys fell apart because of iniuries and other issues and it came down to me alone working to finish the job) I am wondering if I should talk to a bankruptcy lawyer or if there are other options that I should pursue.  

At this point I just want to shut down the company and go back to working as a carpenter, since there is serious demand for carpenters and basically none available and I could land a solid job in a day.  I also want to pay my debts and leave the opening to use the LLC for small side projects and such, but I just don't know if that's possible at this point.  I really fucked up and have learned a lot about accounting since but it is too little too late.  I really want to avoid any serious problems with the IRS and am trying to set up a payment plan that I can afford. What should I do?

TL;DR: one stupid accounting mistake and a bad contract have landed my LLC at about $19k in debt with no cash and no future revenue, 17k of that owed to the IRS.  Do I talk to a bankruptcy lawyer?",0
"Altercation with neighbors...again. Currently residing in NYS and have been having on and off problems with our neighbors. We rescued our dog over a year ago and as a result of going through whatever she went through, she is experiencing problems with anxiety and fear of other dogs. We have been working with a certified trainer for almost a year and have been making great progress. We use a gentle leader, which goes around her face, and due to her dominant tendencies she will paw at it trying to get it off randomly and this sometimes leads her to stand on two back legs with us trying to calm her down. Anyways, when walking we have gotten a lot of positive feedback from neighbors about how well we're doing and the progress we've made. Except for one. The male and female that live a few houses down decided to approach us aggressively saying that we're abusing our dog and swearing, screaming, but not getting too close to us. Even when we tried to explain the training situation, they didn't want to hear it and kept yelling, so we went into our house. This happened about a month ago and due to feeling threatened at the time, we called the police within an hour of it happening. The officer showed up and after telling the situation he said that we are within our rights to train our dog how we want and if they approach us again to tell them to go away. Fast forward to a few days ago. We were walking again in our neighborhood walking and our dog pawed once at her halter and all of a sudden  the same female yelled something, however, we ignored it and kept walking. Shortly after, the female drove her car up and started yelling and cursing again. We replied with we're working with a trainer and we called the cops after last time and we were told we're within our right to train our dog how we see fit. She replied with we're lying and she's within her right to follow us and also said they've called the cops. After ignoring her, she drove off and we turned around to go back to the house. As we came closer to our house, the male was walking down the street yelling something, but we just ignored him and went inside. Again, we called the police and four officers showed up soon after. Upon answering the door, our dog was at the door where they could see and later the officer said that she looks fine and could tell nothing was happening. Anyways, after explaining the situation, one of the officers basically said to go about our business and there's really nothing they can do at this point and if they approach us again, to call the police again. I also should add that after mentioning the neighbors said they've been calling the police, the police confirmed that no one has ever called them. 

Our question is what can and should we do within our legal rights? Currently, we feel unsafe and are planning to go elsewhere to walk our dog. We don't like this because we bought our house and want to enjoy the area, but at what costs? These individuals could escalate the situation to something bad next time, but we also don't think it's fair for us to go elsewhere to walk. Even though there wwere no immediate threats, this still feels like harassment. We don't want the situation to escalate or get out of hand, but at the same time, we don't feel safe or that we're able to enjoy our home and neighborhood. 

Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you!",0
"Neighbors smoking (two types) is setting off the smoke alarm in my apartment. Texas. One of my neighbors (either the one directly behind me or the one directly above me) smokes a lot. It is annoying. You can smell it mostly in the bathrooms but it isn't unusual for it to permeate throughout the house. The bathroom also gets very smokey. Not like smell but obviously smokey. 

My son has a lung disorder and the smoke  often leaves him up at night coughing. It is frustrating. I usually go to my parents or to a hotel but the cost of the hotel will be prohibitive after a while and I'd like to stay in the apartment I rent since I pay for it.  

I've talked to management who says that although I specifically requested and got  a no smoking unit, that they made no promise that the adjacent units would be smoke free. 

The smoke at some points is enough to set off our smoke detectors nearest the guest bathroom. Usually when we are asleep. I complained to the apartment but their response was to send maintenance out to remove the smoke alarm which is near the bedroom and needs to remain there.  So I asked them to put it back up. The office manager suggested just removing the battery. It goes off a couple of times a week, usually after 10 when we are asleep when whoever starts chain smoking. Around that time, we either leave and go to my parents or we go to the opposite end of the apartment to sleep with the window open. 

One of the types of smoking they do is illegal in my state so I've reported them to the police who never come out. 

I have looked in my lease and there is no way to break it. 

I've tried to talk to the neighbor I think it is because he smokes and leaves dropping everywhere over the building (hallway, porches, etc) who basically told me to get lost and never knock on his door again. He dared me to call the police. Which I did but they again have not come out. 

Obviously, my son's health is more important than an apartment lease but I don't make enough money to really break it as they are saying I'll be responsible or the whole of the lease. We've only been there a month. 

I've had a doctor note that since moving into the apartment that my son's lung condition has worsened but he obviously doesn't give a concrete reason why. But he did mention that smoking could cause the condition to worsen. 

It does have a clause about excess noise and nuisance. Saying I have the right to quiet enjoyment of the apartment and the right not be harassed by neighbors. 

Would this be covered under the quiet enjoyment clause?

Also, if they re-rent the apartment they can't collect on the full amount of the least right? They can just collect on the months the unit is unre-rented right? 

So obviously I am moving out but I am trying to cut my loss a bit on the cost of breaking my lease. Medical bills are a huge expensive and I just can't afford to pay two leases at the moment. I've offered to negotiate and give them literally everything in my savings at the moment by paying 3 months of rent upfront if they just let me out of the lease. They declined saying as long as the apartment wasn't inhabitable then the full lease stood. They said they could take the full lease amount and let me move out. I don't have that.  

Can I do anything here? 

Right now, my son is staying with my parents temporarily but it just isn't logistically feasible for a long term solution.",1
"Perforated bowel during colonoscopy, doctor and staff refused to call an ambulance for four hours after I asked. (CT). I have ulcerative colitis and in May I needed a routine colonoscopy with my new GI doctor. I signed all the waivers so I know the doctor is protected on that front but I feel like the way I was treated afterwards was not ethical.
When I woke up I was immediately in pain but assumed it was just gas because it’s common after a colonoscopy. As time went on the pain kept intensifying until I couldn't move or speak loud enough to get anyone's attention. Once my mom was allowed into the recovery area around 9 am she notified the staff and they gave me a heating pad while teasing me for being a baby about a little gas.
A little before 10 am I realized the pain wasn't getting better (it was a 10 on the pain scale) and asked to go to the hospital for the first time. My mom was told that
a.) because it was a medical building they had to be the ones to call an ambulance and that they needed my doctor's permission to call 
b.) they couldn't let me leave on my own without my doctor's permission
c.) that my doctor was with another patient and I'd need to wait to talk to her. 
Unfortunately my mom believed them and went back to the waiting room at their request.
I kind of lost track of time but there were a few events that stood out (please keep in mind that during this entire experience I’m frozen in the fetal position, gasping for air, and I can’t speak louder than a whisper).
*Someone tried to shove saltines into my mouth and when I spit them out onto the gurney I was called nasty. 
*She then shoved a straw in my mouth and when I didn’t drink more than a few sips (I didn’t want any but I was trying to be compliant) she bent down to my face and told me “You need to stop acting like a brat and let me help you.”
*Someone pried my hand off the side of the gurney, forced me onto my back and shoved my legs down flat. I was in too much pain to tell them to stop or make any noise. I quickly ended up back in my original position and was scolded for not working with them.
*I asked to go to the hospital repeatedly and was ignored.
*I asked for my mom and was told she went to lunch (which wasn’t true, she stayed in the waiting room and was told that I was just resting.)
*I asked for my cellphone and was told that they couldn’t open the locker to get it because it was against policy.
*My doctor finally came to see me and told me that I was being too dramatic.
*My mom demanded to be let in and when I asked her to call an ambulance herself the staff finally said they’d call.
When I finally got to the hospital around 2:30 pm my doctor had already called the ER and told them that it was just gas. A few hours later the hospital was getting ready to discharge me without having done any tests (I was told that since my GI was sure it was gas they’d prefer not to expose me to the radiation from an x-ray or CAT scan because I’m a young woman and they didn’t want to affect my reproductive system) when they took my vitals and realized I had started going into severe sepsis. I had an x-ray done that showed I had a bowel perforation and went into emergency surgery. I stayed in the hospital for 13 days, and ended up with a 6 inch incision and an ileostomy.
Was any of this illegal? I don’t want to sue I just don’t want it to happen to someone else.",0
"Question about Roofing insurance contract [FL]. Hey - 

Recently a friend's parents saw there was some damage to their roof and called a few companies in the area to come and take a look - the companies were claiming there was damage from a previous storm. They received a few quotes, but one of the companies had them sign a 'contract' before they would give them a quote. 

The text of the agreement is below


&gt;AGREEMENT SUBJECT TO INSURANCE APPROVAL TERMS

&gt;1. By signing this agreement, you authorize CONTRACTOR NAME Inc. to meet your insurance company's representative for the above named property.

&gt;2. This agreement does not obligate you or CONTRACTOR NAME Inc. in anyway unless the loss (damage) is covered by insurance.

&gt;3. This agreement guarantees the homeowner will have zero out-of-pocket expense above the deductible set forth in the policy. (upgraded materials will be additional)

&gt;4. You authorize CONTRACTOR NAME Inc. to access your property for the purpose of taking accurate measurements and estimates.

&gt;5. If successful in recovering insurance compensation for the loss (damage), CONTRACTOR NAME Inc. will be awarded with the job outlined in the insurance adjuster's summary.

&gt;6. Homeowner agrees to assignment of benefits to Contractor (CONTRACTOR NAME) for payments from insurance company to facilitate timely payments to contractor for all works approved in insurance scope.

&gt;ASSIGNMENT OF INSURANCE BENEFITS: I, the policyholder, named insured or authorized representative, hereby assign any and all Insurance benefits, rights, proceeds and any causes of action under any applicable Insurance policies to CONTRACTOR NAME for services rendered or to be rendered by CONTRACTOR NAME and, in the regard, waive my privacy rights. This assignment is given In consideration of CONTRACTOR NAME’s agreement to perform services as described above, including not requiring full payment at time of service. I also hereby direct my Insurance carrier(s) to release any and all Information requested by CONTRACTOR NAME, Its representative(s) and/or its attorney for the purpose of obtaining benefits to be paid by my Insurance carrier(s) for services rendered or to be rendered and authorize CONTRACTOR NAME and my carrier(s) to communicate as needed with each other this regard.


Now, the insurance company has approved the work to be done, they are uneasy about having this company do the work after speaking with the other companies and having never received a quote for the job from the Company above. The insurance company claimed to receive the quote and it was about $6,000 higher than the next highest quote that they had received.

The insurance company says this is a common 'scam' and the check that will be cut to my friend's parents will be made out to the CONTRACTOR above. Friend's parents want to give the job to another company, but their insurance company won't even write a new check unless they get a 'release of contract' from the shoddy contractor above. Is the contract above valid? Can they push the insurance company to cut a check directly from them without a 'release of contract' and deal with the outcome with the company themselves? There are other details such as apparently the CONTRACTOR above is asking for additional funds (their deductible) which the insurance company has already told my friend's parents that has been removed from the check",0
"Property management company trying to screw us?. So where do I begin? My partner and I lived in an apartment(in St. Louis, Missouri) for 3 years and moved out the first of this month.

There are plenty of details that may or may not be relevant, but I decided to just include the history of our stay there, in case it could be of use. 

Timeline of events:

July 2014 - Signed a lease with first property management company. Simple and straightforward, was done almost entirely online. He tells me to take some pictures of damage and email it to him if I want some repairs. I take *some* pictures, but not in detail. I ask about repairs, but only get little fixes here and there. They clearly were not that invested in the property, but I was okay with it because the rent was cheap.

Fall 2015 - Water main broke, landlord(owner) has to pay for everything. We were without water for a week, but compensated.

Summer 2016 - Property management company lets me know the house is up for sale. He said this doesn't have to change anything for me. He said we can sign a lease as usual, and that is what we did. Same lease as before, just different dates. Business as usual. Soon enough we get a letter from a different property management company (with their address, phone number, etc). I want to repeat that I did not sign a lease with them, it was the first company, but I assume they just took over the lease. I looked up the company's reviews online, and they have terrible ratings. Awful. From this moment on, I've only conversed with one person at the office about repairs, I've had no other contact with any of the people from the company besides a repairman. They did not see the apartment or speak with me.


Early 2017 - We ask for window sill repairs(they had been rotting out for some time). This is something that we bugged the other property management company about, but nothing happened. A repairman did come over, but they did a pretty crappy patch job... This is when we were thinking it might be a good idea to move this summer. 

Summer 2017- In the middle of June, we find out we're approved to move into the apartment we've been looking at. I was concerned about the require notice to vacate before this, so I looked it up online and could only find a 30 day requirement for month-to-month rentals and leases without a fixed end date. Our lease has a fixed end date. Nowhere on our lease does it state that the property management company needs to be notified that we are moving out. It is around a week before our lease was up that we emailed the property management company about our intention to leave, and information about how to get a hold of us.

Yesterday - We get an email back from the company, they seem confused. They say ""do you mean you are leaving at the end of this month?"" We email back and explain ""no we left at the end of last month, that is when our lease was up."" In response, they said they needed a 30 day notice, that it is state law. Now, I had zero knowledge of this. Nothing in the lease. Nothing I could find online said this is true. We haven't responded.

I included lots of info about repairs, and their lack of understanding of the property, because I think these guys are indeed very sketchy, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if they try to withhold our deposit or even try to charge us for damages that were already there. These folks make me nervous. 

I know this was long, thanks in advance!",1
"New car keeps springing leaks. Ontario, Canada

My husband and I bought a new car in March. It was a showroom demo, so it was last year's model and had 10k on it. The manufacturer rebates let us upgrade to a nicer model because it had those kilometers on it. 

At the beginning of May, we brought it in and told them it was leaking from the arm on the driver's side. They tried to say oh maybe the door wasn't shut right. I insisted they look anyways and once they pulled the interior plastic off and put the hose to it, it was like a sprinkler. They ended up pulling off the windshield and reseating it in new seals. At that point I paid nothing because of the warranty.

Now here we are over two months later. We've had a bad smell in the car for about a week. Took a few days to get into the dealer's shop. Asked them to do the free full inspection we got at 3 months owning the car and try to find the smell.

Turns out the back seat floor carpet (we are very very rarely in the backseat as it's just the two of us) is soaking wet and growing mold. 

It's been raining a ton here lately, and we're both anal about closing windows since water in car = bad and nobody likes a wet butt. A couple weeks back it was raining so hard people were pulling over from low visibility, and we thought we heard water in the car but assumed it was splashing in the wheel well. 

When the dealer service guy called back he told me this, said I had to have left a window open, and that I'd need to get the car detailed to ditch the smell. 

I explained while it's not impossible that we left a window open, it's very unlikely, and our car had an established history of fucking leaking water inside. The guy repeated what he said and told us our car could be picked up. I hung up with him and called back to speak to the manager in service. 

I told the manager I was beyond frustrated because we bought new specifically to avoid things like this. If we were gonna dump this much money into a car every year instead of it being a 13 year old junker trying to stay driving might as well buy new. I explained I didn't like being told it's my fault too bad, same as last time when I was told I must have ""shut the door wrong"" and it was a leak. That I suspect it's a leak again. That I don't want to come back for ""oop third time's the charm found all the leaks"". Service Manager laughed and said he doesn't want me in again unless it's routine service. 

At this point the manager is sending it to a body shop owned by a good guy who my family sends all our business too, and I called him and he'll have his guys go through the car top to bottom to make sure everything is sealed right. 

I'm very concerned about damage to the car. It's not even 4 months old. 

1. At what point is the car a ""lemon"" and does that kind of thing even apply here? 

2. What happens if the floor boards are rusted from the wet carpet for so many weeks (and who knows how long before that? Last summer when the sales guy drove it around?)

3. What happens if I keep finding leaks for all eternity? 

4. What steps should I take to resolve this if things aren't being fixed? Like dealer/owner first, then corporate, then lawyer? My insurance? The warranty people? 

This is our first time owning a brand new car that won't end up being sold to a scrapper for finally dying down. Please help. I'm lost and angry and not sure where to go next while I wait for the verdict from the body shop.",0
"[CA, Los Angeles] An innocent baby is suffering... I suspect medical negligence. How do I begin getting some help?. Hello r/legaladvice and the Reddit community as  whole. First I want to quickly say thank you for the advice you gave me a few days ago on this subreddit concerning my in-laws and me. You steered us away from something that could've really blown up in our faces. What I ask next of you weighs on my heart and soul so heavy I feel like collapsing from within. I'll do my best to keep it short.

Maybe 36 hour's ago baby Gia (I'll call her Gia since I've not gotten permission to use real names) was born to a mother and father that loved her deeply and have been excited to meet her. She was born with six different conditions that we know of at the moment. I just got off with the father who is my best friend (I'll call him Al for now). Al’s devastated and the nurses and doctors keep telling him they've never seen anything like this before, well at least not all at the same time in one baby. They're both very healthy adults, Al's 30 and his wife's 23. I didn't ask too many questions about her conditions because I felt he needed me to listen more than talk but what I got from it is that she has Leukemia (or some cancer like it, I'm unsure here), a very large blood clot threatening her heart an enlarged kidney, a valve in her heart is closed or obstructed somehow, she can't breathe because the blood vessels to her lungs aren't transferring blood and she has a hole in her heart. My heart is breaking as I write this so I'll just finish as fast I can. Nurses and doctors at Kaiser have told them looking over her charts and medical records that so much of this could've been caught early had they run some standard tests but because his wife was young they assumed it would be ok. Their doctor denied them several tests they asked about throughout the pregnancy and when the first ultrasound was incomplete (they couldn't even determine the sex) they refused to schedule another one. To find out the sex they had to go to one of those private 3d imagining companies. The medical staff has been sympathetic and supporting but the administration has been giving him the run-around. They told him they're doing an internal investigation and I think he's having trouble even getting her medical records from them. He asked for them early on with witnesses from the head the department but when he brings it up now they can't give him an answer as to when he'll get it or how this could've been missed. All this while poor Gia is fighting for her life, he can't even get the info he needs to get a second opinion. I have to stop now, it's hard to even see what I'm typing. Please help Reddit.


Is this grounds for medical malpractice or something like that?


What kind of attorney should Al seek? And when should he seek it?


Should he wait until the investigation is concluded? Does he have a right to read the results?


Is there another subreddit I can post this on for more help in any areas I'm too ignorant to even know I'll m missing? Also what's the best way to do this, I'm new to posting on Reddit, just lurked around on my other handle and I don't want to spam Reddit.


If there's any questions I can ask or information you guys need please let me know and I'll ask Al. This is so early on he's still dealing with the emotional blow. Btw I did ask permission to ask for help on his behalf so long as it was anonymously.",0
"Ex-roommate harassing me for money nearly 2 months after moving out [Spain]. Hey, everyone. I'm in Spain but I'm happy to accept general legal advice that doesn't necessarily pertain to Spain because there was never a contract or any legal documents so...

Okay so in February I moved into a shared flat and told them I'd stay until the end of May. The head roommate who had the apartment in his name, let's call him Juan, told me I'd owe 120 euros a month plus bills which would ""be about 20 euros a month."" That was it. There were no contracts, documents, or anything at all. I just handed him cash each month when he told me how much bills were.

*Incidentally I ended up moving in with my boyfriend at his place like 3 weeks after renting my flat, so I was literally never there. I spent a total of maybe 10 nights there in the 3 months I rented, and they even had some other person renting my room by the end of May before I officially moved out. That doesn't really change anything, but it's relevant I guess.*


So, on May 31st when I went to pay my last rent payment, Juan told me ""there will be some bills coming in a few weeks for the electricity and whatnot. I will let you know""

I was a bit confused and thrown off because previously, I'd always paid the bills at the end of each month. Well, I didn't think much of it, paid him my money, and left.

I didn't hear anything from him, not a word, until July 10th, a month and a half later.

Out of the blue he texts me and says ""the water bill arrived for May  - June 1. You owe 10.50. Can you deposit it in my bank account? There will also be another bill coming for the electricity, but I don't have it yet. There could be another one after that, too. I will let you know.""

I told him ""can I just pay you in cash like we always did?"" and he said ""sure but can you do it today? I'm leaving tomorrow""

I'm angry now: you give me a 1-day limit on a random bill over a month later? So I tell him ""fine, I'll deposit it in your account"" and he says okay. 

Well, I'm busy. I have two jobs. I didn't have time to run to the bank. I got another text from him yesterday ""hello, can you please deposit the money today or tomorrow"" and I told him I'd go as soon as I could. Then today I got ANOTHER text message, ""Hello, can you deposit that money today?""

I'm kind of raging at this point. I'm beyond annoyed. PLUS, this is only the first of potentially 2 more bills that will arrive at random dates. So he's potentially going to be harassing me all summer.

I'm angry because:

1. he's charging me bills nearly two months after moving out for water that I didn't even use *(I DO understand that technically I agreed to split the water bill with the other roommates and technically I owe this money, I'm just pointing out how petty it is to actually charge me the 10 bucks)* AND there was someone else renting my room for at least the last week of May.

2. Instead of waiting until he has all of the bills and charging me once, he's charging me 3 times at random intervals

3. He's constantly harassing me to drop what I'm doing and pay the money right now, even though he's randomly texting me a month and a half after moving out, and during the work week. 


On top of all that, I haven't even SEEN any of these bills. No pictures or proof. He's just randomly texting ""hey btw u totes owe 10 bucks k pls pay rite now""

So what are my rights? What do I do? I don't want to be annoyed by this clown all summer.",1
"Dog bit landlord (who was being dumb). Landlord gave notice to vacate, says he's taking medical costs out of deposit. Iowa, USA.. I have two dogs who were both in their kennels. One had minor surgery yesterday and we had just gotten home when the vet called because they forgot to give me a prescription he needs, and asked me to come get it.

While I was gone my landlord came over unannounced. Apparently the house next door, he also owns, had water in the basement from storms. He wanted to see if my basement was flooding too.

However apparently he was concerned about my dogs because one (the one who had surgery) wasn't moving much (he was still groggy) and the other was whining a lot (she was fine, she just whines when she's in her kennel but someone's around and she wants out).

He said that he and his wife were afraid that the dogs were in bad shape and needed water or something, so he let them out. He got the younger one (who just had surgery) out first and apparently the other (still in her kennel) started growing. She can be defensive of the younger one so I am guessing she was upset that a stranger was messing with the younger one who wasn't well.  She had been extra attentive to him since he got home licking him and trying to give him food so I think she could tell something was wrong with him.

Apparently even though the older dog was growling, they still let her out of her kennel. They said that the younger one went under the bed and the older one tried to keep them away from it, growling and barking when they tried to get the puppy out. Apparently they kept trying to get close, and eventually the landlord pulled the puppy out from under the bed and my older girl bit his hand. 

When I got home, they were still trying to get the puppy who had gone back under the bed, and my older dog was going nuts wimpering/barking/growling at them.  The landlord's wife had called animal control.  The bite had broken the landlord's skin just barely but was no longer bleeding.

Animal control came and checked my paperwork for shots and said normally they would take the dog for quarantine because it was involved in a bite incident, but they said that in these circumstances they didn't see a need to do so. They told me that I shouldn't expect any further issues with the situation and that they would talk to the landlord about what he should have done differently.

I thought that was it, however my landlord went to the ER. His wife told me that the ER didn't believe any treatment was needed but they elected to go through rabies meds just in case, so he is going through that treatment now.

Today they delivered a letter to my mailbox saying that they want me out by the end of the month or no more than 30 days from now because my animals have presented a dangerous situation on the property that keeps them from fulfilling their ownership duties safely.  He also told me in the letter that he will be keeping his ER visit and rounds of rabies meds from my deposit but that if the bills exceed it he will be forwarding me the bill.

At this point I'm not really even sure what I'm asking for other than just general advice anyone might have. It's probably obvious from my post but I am very frustrated by the situation because I had my dog properly contained and they chose to let them out even though the dog was growling, which should have been a warning sign to leave it alone. However I am not sure what the law says on this or what I'm in for.",1
"[Ontario] Water softener rental with house purchase. So I bought my house around 5 years ago and when I bought it, it came with a water softener.  Unknown to me, the softener was a rental.

Fast forward 5 years, the previous owner of the house has now passed away and the estate has noticed that she had been paying for the rental for the last 5 years, which came to around $1500.  My real estate agent contacted me and told me that the estate would probably be contacting me, which they did through a letter.  In the letter they didn't ask for the $1500 but they did ask me to contact the rental company to assume the rental. 

I contacted the rental company and they wanted me to assume control of the contact, which I have never seen. I obviously would rather not since after talking to them, paying for this rental is $25/month and the agreement goes on for another 10 years or so.  I'll end up paying $3000 myself on top of the $1500 that the estate already paid for a water softener that's worth $2000.  Buying it out is going to cost me $800 and it's already a 7 year old unit.  

I found a contract from the same company that that has this verbiage about transferring the agreement, although I have no idea if it is the same as the contract that was actually signed by the previous owner.
&gt; Transferring This Agreement: If you are the Owner and you sell or otherwise transfer the Premises, you are required to inform the transferee, at or before the effective date of the sale or transfer, of the existence of this Agreement and the rental Equipment installed in the Premises. We will permit the purchaser to assume your rights and obligations under this Agreement, effective from the date of sale, or other transfer, provided that (i) you or your representative notify the transferee in the sale or transfer agreement that the Equipment is rented and is subject to this Agreement, (ii) you or your representative advise us in advance of the transferee’s name and the intended date of sale or other transfer, (iii) you or your representative advise us in advance of the address and telephone number where you can be contacted after the date of sale or transfer, (iv) the transferee agrees to assume your obligations, and (v) you have paid us all amounts owing under this Agreement. Unless and until these conditions are satisfied, or unless we otherwise waive any or all of these conditions, which we are under no obligation to do, you will remain responsible (individually or jointly and severally with the Lessee, as applicable) for the Equipment rental and your obligations under this Agreement, including making all rental payments. You hereby authorize us to respond to information requests relating to your account made by or on behalf of the transferee. We may (but are not required to) accept performance of your obligations (including payment obligations) from other parties (such as tenants).

My houses purchase agreement states that I would assume control of any rentals but neither real estate agent or lawyer seemed to have followed up on this or made the transfer.  My real estate agent is pretty adamant that this is a rent-to-own and not a rental and not explicitly stated in the purchase agreement.   

So, I'm not too sure what to do.  Try to push this back on the estate and tell them they didn't follow through with the agreement?  Bite the bullet and assume the rental until I can get out of it?  Some other option?  If anybody has any thoughts, I'd greatly appreciate it.",1
"Lease ended during an ownership transition. Signed new lease but was told I would have to sign a new one. Tenant at will for a month now and worried.. Hi everyone.

I live in Massachusetts. I moved into this apartment complex in 2015 right when it was built. I was one of the first people to move into my building. The apartment management has been pretty flukey and not great since the start, but I've always brushed it off since my apartment is gorgeous, the complex offers nice amenities, and my utilities are consistently unbelievably cheap. 

My lease ended on June 30th. On June 28th, the complex announced that they had been sold to a new management company. I made sure to email the new management, CCing the old management, to let them know that my lease was ending. I am on an affordable unit plan since I was working as an intern when I first moved there... I have since gotten a full time job with great pay but still fall under the ""current tenant income limit"" which is 140% of the new tenant cutoff. I explained that I had all of my paperwork for the income verification ready to drop off and that I was prepared to sign my lease at their earliest convenience. 

After verifying all of my paperwork, they provided me with an online lease on June 29th. I noticed several errors in the lease, but was afraid to wait to sign it since I was already on my final day of my last lease. This happened last year as well, but I was close with the leasing office manager and ended up signing the lease and following it up with a comprehensive email to him regarding any and all corrections. This year, I did the same. I signed the lease, saved a copy of the lease to my computer (pre-signing... I do not have a copy of the signed lease, I'll explain why in a bit) and then emailed them a list of corrections and questions.

I received an email on July 1st that read ""Please stop by office at your earliest convenience. Our apologies, but there is a good chance we will have to have you re-sign the lease due to the change in management. I'm here today until 4:00 and here on Monday from 10-3. Thank you!"" 

I stopped by the leasing office that day around 2 and was told, ""Oh, the lease isn't ready yet. We will contact you when it is."" I emailed them again on July 5th to say, ""Just checking in since I stopped by on Saturday around 2pm and was told that the lease was not ready yet. Do you know when it will be ready for me to re-sign? Also, when will residents regain access to the web portal?""

Now, I should note that everything at my apartment is done via the web portal. After I was told that I would likely need to resign my lease, I tried to sign in to the web portal to try and obtain a copy of the signed lease but found that they had shut it down while they transitioned to a new host. This is why I do not have a copy of the signed lease. 

They responded with ""We will have this out to you as soon as possible! And the resident portal will be back up for 8/1 to be able to pay rent online. Thank you for your patience while we make this transition!"" 

This past Monday, July 10th, I stopped at the leasing office to pick up a package. The woman in the office again reassured me that my lease would be ready to sign soon and that I am ""still within [my] lease"" so I shouldn't be worried. However, if they are in fact considering the lease I signed on June 29th to be null and void, I am not within my lease. 

Should I be worried? Is there a chance that I will somehow be screwed over in this process?",1
"How to treat misclassified independent contractor position. I work for a small company doing manual labor. For the sake of keeping this somewhat private for now, we will say I do lawn maintenance although what I actually do is specific to the area I live and is in high demand. I started working for the company about a year ago. My boss (owner of the company) hired me to fill in for someone who had recently been fired, and him and I (as his helper) were the entire company. I started at $10/hr. As time progressed, i took on more responsibility and after about 4 or 5 months, started doing nearly 100% of the work by myself. My boss then hired a worker to be my helper, and began more of a role that consisted more of doing estimates and taking phone calls. He is not a super presentable guy, though he is very friendly, he's just kind of got this very country/hillbilly vibe about him. Ever since I started working with him, business has been growing substantially faster than it did in the previous 2 years of him owning the company. business is now stronger than ever, and i am being worked to the bone in the summer heat every day using and depending on equipment that is far beyond being in need of repair. It has gotten frustrating to be in charge of everything, (working my *** off), and maintaining to represent the company to the best of my ability, all while making $12/hour on jobs that bring company $2,000-$3000 profit every two days. 

This being said, I learned a few months ago that my boss had taken my social security number that he made a copy of when I first started working for him to make me an LLC, unannounced to me. This also included filing a ""workers compensation exemption form"" on my behalf for me. The worker who is my helper is also filed on that llc as my employer/subcontractor (not sure which)I do like my boss, and don't really mind the work if it was for more money, I just feel underpaid for the major role I play in the company. 

For the past few months I've been saving and working towards gathering all materials I need to begin doing jobs myself (trailer, about $2000 worth of equipment). I now have almost everything I need, and am only short of getting my own business liability insurance and business license to have everything complete. 

My question is, how would you approach the situation if you were in my position? I do like my boss and wouldn't mind continuing to subcontract for his company. However, I'm not sure how he will handle the news that I may become his competition. The way I see it- For the entire length of employment with this company, I have been miscatagorized as a subcontractor. I am now doing what is necisarry for me to actually be subcontracted by him (or another company in the same field.. 2 of which have offered to pay me more than double what my current boss does, but those two company's were both under the impression at the time that the equipment I had with me was all mine when it was actually my current bosses). An arrangement where I help to train my worker to fill my position while my own business picks up seems ideal to me, but am I being too hopeful thinking he would continue to employ me when he knows I'm going to give him competition on my own? I know he is going to feel betrayed and tell me it's a bad idea etc. I'm just trying to think of the best way to present it to him so that the process that both he and I will soon undergo is relatively seamless. I feel like we could both still help each other to an extent, I'm just not sure how to phrase it.",0
"Content being posted to Pornhub without my knowledge or consent [Quebec]. Hi. I’m in Quebec right now, but am an American citizen. I would appreciate any advice you can give on a situation involving videos being uploaded to Pornhub without my knowledge or consent. For context, I’m an independent sex worker. 

Last year I moved in with a couple after my boyfriend passed. They reached out and offered me to stay in their home “rent-free” after they read a post I wrote in a private forum about the death and needing a place to stay.  [Here is that conversation](http://i.imgur.com/v8pbC2Z.png?2). They said we could “work together” while I saved up money, and as someone who is self-employed, I took that as meaning we could collaborate on videos to sell.

I did move out there with them. I did stay rent-free.  I did shoot some videos. We agreed that some would go on our separate websites, and that some would go on Pornhub. We discussed where they went before posting them. 

Fast forward to after I moved out (there’s stuff that happened in between, but it’s not relevant), I see one of the videos we agreed would be on a paid website pop up their Pornhub channel. This was not discussed beforehand. 

This was [their](http://imgur.com/a/yGW4T) explanation for why they didn’t have to tell me. She’s green, I’m white. 

The name blurred out was the woman in charge of payments at Pornhub. Our Pornhub accounts were not linked. [This is the conversation](http://imgur.com/a/VIFVR) I had with the payments lady (sorry it’s so confusing, there’s a lot block out) at Pornhub. I told her I do not want our accounts linked in anyway. [This](http://i.imgur.com/BFdhGTE.jpg) is where their names would appear if our accounts were linked/shared. I never signed any paperwork with this couple. No model release forms. I never gave them my identification cards. They don’t even know my full name. 

# Also, when you upload things to pornhub, you have to agree that all parties have knowledge that it’s being posted to Pornhub and that all parties consent to it being posted on Pornhub. 
[Here is that disclaimer](http://i.imgur.com/MtxC0P2.png).

I’ll be honest, I didn’t really know my rights at the time, so I was soft in handling this and dropped it. 

Fast forward to a few leeks later, they inform me that they’re pulling another website video and putting it on Pornhub. This one was significant for me because it was the only video I’m physically involved in. I told them I did not want that video put on Pornhub and they’re saying it doesn’t matter. 

[This is how that conversation went.](http://imgur.com/a/CcVeH) I’m purple, they’re white. 

Even if they are right and they “own the content” (the filming equipment was theres), am I wrong in believing they still need to inform me before posting anything with me in it, and that I would still need to consent to it being posted on Pornhub? 

I’d like to know if there’s action I can take against the video that’s up currently. I also want to know if there’s any action I can take  if she does end up releasing the video that I’m not consenting to being posted. I’m currently still waiting to hear back from Pornhub, so far they’ve been silent. I’ve filled out three content removal requests forms. To be fair, I know she’s really big on Pornhub and I’m pretty insignificant there, so I’m not surprised it’s taking this long. 

I know this is a little long, but thanks for reading. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks so much.",0
"Taxi driver refused to let me go-what are my rights?. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, and it's very long, but I'll give it a shot. Disclaimer: I already know I made poor choices and deserved what I got. Just asking for advice. 

I was out very late on a Saturday and didn't want to stay at any of my friends' places (1st mistake). Ended up on a train to my parents' house late at night. My dumb self fell asleep on the train (not even drunk, just exhausted) and missed my stop. This was late at night and I didn't want to wait 20 mins for nearest uber, so I just got in the first cab that showed up at the station(also stupid, I know). 

Cab driver doesn't tell me how much the fare is going to be but says flat out he will only accept cash. The ride was 15 minutes...I figured it would be  a ripoff, had $20 in cash and called my dad to let him know I'd need him to come out with more cash for the guy. Dad agrees, all is well. The guy had a dispute over $3 with the girl I shared the cab with, who got dropped off before me. Cursed her out even though she did give him the (very overpriced) fare. He got nasty with me after she left and said $40 for you, do you hear me?! Fine. I tell my dad the exact amount. I'm a girl, alone at night, and look younger than I am. I just wanted to go home and neither my dad nor I cared about the fare amount at this point. 

We get to the house and he says to give him $40. I open my bag for the $20 and start to explain, and my dad is waiting there with the door open ready to come give the guy cash. Without even letting me get a word in this guy locks the doors, speeds up and won't let me out of the cab. He says ""If you don't give me my f***ing money you're never getting out of this car."" Okay dude I'm trying to tell you that you're going to  get your money. I'm terrified and just unlock the door and jump out while the car's still moving. I guess he slowed down out of surprise because I managed not to bust my face open.

I call the cops with his plate # and they run my license and presumably his (I was explaining to my mom what happened and my dad was outside talking to the cops so I'm not 100% sure if they ran the guy's license, but I would assume so for the police report). Cops basically talk me out of doing anything because ""You have to understand, he's probably had people try and skip out on fares before."" Fine, I get it, I'm sure there are a lot of jerks out there who rip off cab drivers. But if he actually thought I was trying to stiff him, why not keep me in the car in front of the house and call the cops unless someone in the house brought him money? Like, isn't that the logical thing to do instead of driving off with someone (who doesn't have the full fare anyway) against their will and threatening them?

Also, the guy got out of the car to start screaming at my dad. While he did this my dad grabbed the car keys so he couldn't leave until the cops got there. The guy then told the cops my dad kidnapped him. Technically he did take his car keys but only to keep him from driving off before the cops could get here, after he sees his daughter run down the block out of a moving vehicle at 4:30 am. He didn't keep him there to hurt him. But the cops ultimately said they couldn't charge this guy for kidnapping without charging my dad as well.

Again, I realize I made dumb decisions and realize why the guy could assume I was trying to skip out on a fare. But does that really justify what he did? I was terrified out of my mind..you can't just drive off with someone against their will. Or can you?",0
"(Landlord North Carolina) potential tenants promised to park uhaul in driveway but moved right in. Cross post. From legal help.

u/Freckas
((I can't edit title- people moved in property will not sign or pay I need them out. They started bull dozing me from the beginning but it was not obvious until they were inside the property and started haggling me down on rent and deposit. ))

Hindsight is 20/20. I realize now my mistakes: Holding rental property with out deposit or signed lease or any money what so ever.

The wife of the couple 23f and 23 m military put me on the spot several times.

Things I've tried to graciously provide but is turning and in fact turned into a nitpicking negotiating, bulldozing nightmare.

""Reduce the pet fee since one pet is emotional therapy but will not prove it""

""Let us paint (before even seeing the house it's recently been professionally painted for 2k)""

""Let us meet you in the middle of the night, give us directions for an hour, invite all our friends and bang on the door,oh we forgot the money, we didn't bring the signed lease, we couldn't find a printer, we don't want to sign the lease until we pay and didn't want to pay until we found out your a real person not a craigslist killer""

Everything screams (I'm an idiot me the op and they are entitled)

They've been in the house since 1am Saturday, can't get them to answer to meet up for the lease and payment, they promised they would but like everything else they just end up doing what they want.

When I called this evening they finally answered and instead of giving me a time to meet they say ""we don't wanna pay the full month and want you to take off money from the deposit we have a list of discrepancies, and instead of 865 we want to pay 500""

I explained I already did the walk through with them every appliance is new, we did not provide a washer and had warned them that, now that is a bargaining chip for them.

I saw the writing on the wall and said ""You've not paid any money you've not signed a lease and you've not stopped making demands-it's clear I'm not going to make you happy this isn't working""

He says ""I need a week"" but also cusses me out and threatens me that they haven't signed anything so he doesn't have to do ""jack S----""

I say ""please no hard feelings but this will never work you've not jumped through any of the hoops that tenants are supposed to and I've had to do every single thing what your asking me to do now is too much special treatment""

The house could pass a military inspection it was spotless ontop and behind appliances professionally cleaned.

They are not in the same reality... I know really shouldn't have let them move their stuff in but they were ""please don't make us get a storage unit tonight just for one night"" and he is a marine who just got back the beginning of the month, I didn't know things would get so out of hand but they kept pushing.

I ended the conversation by saying I might be able to give you 48 hour but I need you guys out because I really did hold the house for you and this has gotten out of hand, your not wanting to pay and your taking advantage of me (my stupidity in reality).

What do I do? I need to know my rights, I am getting a property manager but I would like to get them out since they have no intention of really paying and keep stalling.

I have his commands number but I do not know legally if they are squatters or what I have done. We only want them gone with out retaliating in the form of damage.

I've already called power and water company to inform them that no one has permission to be there.",1
"[FL]I signed up for a gym before the gym officially opened. The grand opening date was tentative. I asked the manager to delay the activation of my gym membership until I actually went for the first time. They charged me for 2 months that I wasn't there for. What are my options?. I signed up for the UFC gym in South Florida back in September. I had purchased a groupon for 30$ for a one month trial. I wanted to get a full membership when I went in to sign up, so they told me that they would waive the enrollment fee and I would have to pay first month ($59), last month($63), and the processing fee($52).
They had a tentative opening date which kept getting pushed back. There are loads of disgruntled people that left angry facebook comments expressing their frustration. So I spoke with the manager and asked if they could push back the activation of my membership until I officially started using the gym. My thought process was why get stuck paying two memberships if the date is pushed back again and I am forced to get another month at my current gym and they then open up midway through my last month.
Sure enough the date was pushed back from end of October until the end of November. So I continued using my current gym until mid December when I first started going to the UFC gym. I was told that I wouldn't have to pay until my third month because my first month was already paid for and the groupon was taking care of the second month.
On December 23rd I check in to the gym and the lady at the counter says that my balance is past due. I was confused, but then spoke to the guy who signed me up who still remembered who I was and said to comeback when the manager was here and we'd get it taken care of. After a couple weeks of being given the run around, I speak with the guy who signed me and the manager and explain the situation. Apparently I never got credit for the groupon, and my first month that was paid for went into effect as soon as they opened (as opposed to it taking effect once I had actually started using the gym).
I explain the whole situation to the manager and he agrees that my membership should have started once I started using the gym not when they opened, and he also agreed that I should be given credit for the groupon. He tells the guy who signed me up to leave a note on his desk and he'll take care of it by not charging me anything for the following two months.
The next month comes around, and I am charged again. I explain the situation again to the guy who signed me and he said to speak to the manager. This guy is elusive as fuck. Never at the gym. I asked one of the workers who I happened to know if he was in one day, and she said no and asked what she could help with. I get the guy who signed me up and explained the whole situation to her, and was like I just want my money refunded. We go to the computer and says she all she could was waive the bill for the following to months. I agree to this and actually see her make the changes on the computer.
Next month comes around, and I am charged yet again. By this point I'm honestly over it and say I will take care of it later. I am in the process of writing an email to UFC gym in hopes that they once and for all refund me for the two months I should have never paid for. I have the necessary proof, the date I officially started going to that gym, the groupon, my bank statements with proof that I paid, the contract, the guy who signed me up remembers, and if he is feeling forgetful I also have my friend that made the changes.
I am hoping that'll be enough to get them to give me my refund, however if they don't, what are my options? Thanks in advance!",0
"Lease Agreement / Lease Advice Help?. So I recently have had a situation arise with my place of living. Would be extremely helpful if someone could take a look at my situation who might have knowledge with leases and lease agreements and agreements made over places of living.

So since 2014 I have been living in the same apartment with a room mate. He has been significantly longer than I have. However we are in the same boat in this issue.

So, as of April 1 2017 our lease has been up or done. Normally we resign our lease no issues. This year however as the date was approaching we brought it up a time or two and finally when we went to pay rent for the month of April, there was no lease presented to us. Instead we were told ""Dont worry guys its fine, your on for another year"" without us actually signing anything. We leave our April rent payment both a little uneasy but take our property manager on their word and figure we will get it a week or 2 later. So we mention the lease and needing to resign it multiple times and we keep hearing ""dont worry guys your on for the same agreement no problem"". This has been going on since April all the way to yesterday July 11th.

Keep in mind we've been asking for the lease to resign on it weekly for this whole 3 and a half month period, while paying the amount of rent we did each month for 2016 and were being told ""your good for another year, do not worry guys"". We heard this over and over again from our property manager.

As of yesterday July 11th we are now being told by our property manager our lease is in fact not good and we are not ok and we were right to be worrying this whole time. They are now telling us the owner/landlord (who we have not met, been giving contact info for, or even heard over the phone) wants to raise our rent and have us resign the lease asap. This aggressive move leaves us in between a rock and a hard place. We either resign the lease and in August start paying a Significantly higher rate of rent or move out by the end of the month.

Is this something that they can legitimately do, withholding our lease from us for over a 3 month period while telling us verbally our agreement is solid and we should not worry, then flip the situation on us and say ""Resign the lease or gtfo"". Do we have an recourse in this to say this is not right?

I also want to mention a few things. My room mate who has lived in this place far longer than I have and has a good relationship as I do with the property manager, and we have always paid rent on time, and fixed what we could around the apartment including wear and tear such things like bathroom vent fans, and other minor issues. We have worked with the property manager to get compensated for some of the work we have done to keep the apartment nice and in good conditions. We have not done anything to result in us being undesirable tenants, this is simply a matter of a greedy landlord trying to get more money. 
However I also need to point out that because of the age of the building and the refusal to fix roof leaks (for multiple winter seasons) on part of the owner, my room mate has black mold which has been photographed and shown to the property manger and still nothing has been done about it.

Giving what I have typed above. Is there anything we can do. Last of all we live in Summit County Colorado. People who rent dont seem to have many rights here in this county, however this situation giving the verbal BS we were told and the withholding of the lease, followed by this force to resign a new a lease (nearly 4 months into what should be an active lease from April), does not seem legit to me. Please help. What can we do?",1

"GF purchased car from my dad [NJ], my dad never transferred title or registration, been 2 years and still hasn't done anything, we moved to CA. What to do?. Long time lurker, first time poster, so please excuse any formatting mistakes or anything.

Basically, back in June 2015, my dad was tight on money, so to help him out, my gf and I decided to purchase his 2011 Nissan Murano off of him. She got an auto loan to pay the car for approx $15,000. This mean my gf would have a total of two cars, an Infiniti Sedan, and now a Nissan Murano SUV. Every time we approached him to sign over the title and registration, he claimed he was too busy and stuff (we opened a restaurant together). On our off days, he was always wanting to stay home and do his own thing instead of just signing it over, and he would sometimes get mad when we bugged him about it. This all happened in NJ. We currently posses the only copy of the title, but it is in my dad's name.

Fast forward to about Feb 2017, we got into a series or arguments that basically ended in me and gf moving from NJ to CA. As stated before, the 3 of us (Gf, myself, and dad) opened a moderately successful restaurant in NJ, but the my dad was essentially emotionally abusing us throughout the course of the restaurant (calling us worthless/names constantly, yelling at us all the time, throwing things near us to scare us). We could no longer deal with it, so we packed our bags and moved to CA, and took the Infiniti as the car to road trip in. We finally got to CA in April 2017, and we realized we still haven't gotten the title or registration transferred to my gf's name. We are still paying the auto loan for the Nissan (loan under her name), and the Nissan Murano is still with my dad back in NJ. We obviously live in CA now, so we can't just take the car, and we would prefer not to speak to him, but will do so if it benefits us financially.

I sent him an email about a month ago telling him he needs to transfer the title and registration to her name, or he needs to take over the loan payment. He did not respond. 

Right now, as it stands, these are the issues:

1.) We are paying for a car that we do not possess (we are in CA and the car is in NJ).

2.) Dad is currently using our car for his own work/personal use (He is in NJ using the car).

3.) We are paying for the auto loan that is under our name. We took out that auto loan to purchase the Nissan Murano from my dad.

The possible solutions that I would like to happen would be:

1.) We are able to bring the car to CA, and preferably sell it just to pay off the auto loan

OR

2.) He takes over the loan payment.

I am not too comfortable on letting him take over the loan payment as he has abused his power in the past, and he is the type of individual to not pay the loan just to ruin my gf's credit.

OTHER INFORMATION:

He currently owns the restaurant that me, my gf, and him worked on together (he financed, we put in sweat equity, no pay for 1.5 years, but that's another issue). He definitely has the money to either purchase the car back OR purchase another car of his own. We just do not want to be stuck with a payment for a car that we do not have. When we finally get the car, we would most likely sell it to pay back the loan.

My questions to the readers are:

1.) What would be the best route to obtain the registration?

2.) How would we transfer the name of the title and registration to my gf's name?

3.) How would we get possession of the car?

4.) Is there anyway to punish my dad for his actions? Will there be any punishment on our end for being unable to transfer the title and registration to our names?

Thank you all so much!",0
"(IL) sublessee took rent money from new sublessee and has not paid rent.. A couple months back I subletted a room in my apartment after my roommate needed to move out. Both the original roommate and me are on the lease, which ends August 1st. Because of the short notice, I found someone on a facebook roommate search group (I will refer to him as FR for former roommate). I spoke to the landlord, who requested an application and background check from FR, which was given to him. I asked about writing up my own sublease, but was told not to worry about it, that the landlord would prefer to write one up himself. To my knowledge he never got around to writing up the sublease. 

About three weeks back, FR told me he got a temporary job in another city and would need to leave that weekend. He said he would have the rent, but would likely look for a sublet for his sublet. A couple days later he found someone (who I will refer to as NR for new roommate), who started moving in the next day. I asked FR if he had been in contact with the landlord, which he said he had. I talked to the landlord, it turned out he had not. The landlord made it clear that the NR should not have moved in without his consent, but was willing to organize getting the application from him and work it out.  NR was oblivious to all this, but when told of the situation was quick to get all necessary documents to the landlord. 

The day before rent was due I organized with FR to drop off rent. I learned from NR that FR had collected rent money from him and was planning to hand it to me, so that I could give it to the landlord. FR claimed to be busy, so we organized for the next day. FR kept pushing the time back for when he’d drop off rent; I offered to pick it up, but he rejected the offer. When the landlord showed up to pick up rent, I apologized that FR had not showed up yet, to which the landlord informed me that FR told him I would be covering the rent in full. We were confused, but figured it could be a miscommunication and scheduled for the next day. At that point, I learned from NR that he had been told that the rent had already been paid. FR did not show up the next day either. 

It is about a week later, and FR has made multiple excuses and has not shown up at any time he has told us that he would to drop off rent. I have asked him to send it to me via an app, but he claims that he cannot deposit the money because it is in cash and he does not have a local bank. I learned from NR that FR took $160 more than the cost of rent and insisted he give it to him in cash. It is apparent from the multiple discrepancies that FR does not plan on paying rent or returning the money that NR gave him. Luckily NR, the landlord, and I have been in full cooperation with one another, and have text messages citing the discrepancies in what FR has told us. The landlord suggested NR go to the police to file a report for the money that was taken, but the police informed us they could not do anything and this would need to be settled in civil court.

My question is what can we do about this situation? What rights do FR, NR, the landlord, and I have? I don’t have much hope for myself having any legal footing in terms of my own rights in this situation. I realize as the leaseholder, I am responsible for full rent. Unfortunately I won’t have the funds to cover the full rent until the end of the month, and will likely need to cover this with the deposit. How severely will this affect my ability to rent apartments in the future? Does NR have a case for fraud in civil court? How can the landlord and I support him in this? Also, FR has left some things in the apartment, and has attempted to get them back. What are his rights in terms of the things left behind?",1
"Got fired for refusing to work with someone who kept calling me a gringo.. I worked as a crew leader for a landscaping company in NV off and on for two years. Last Wednesday I was sent to work with another crew because they where short on people due to two or three people quitting the week prior. I had worked with this crew a few times before and due to them being short on people and hadn't had any major issues other than that I was made to do a majority of the work while they where often either just standing around talking or nowhere to be found. There was one individual who I could tell didn't like me from the first time I met him and I could tell it was a racial thing(he was Hispanic and while I have native blood in me I'm usually assumed by others to be white). In a job like landscaping you have to have thick skin, it's all dudes and it's all outside manual labor. I can put up with a lot, and for a while I did. Now I don't speak Spanish, but it's not hard to figure out when I hear the word gringo while they are talking, then immediately after tell me to go do something(I was often the only ""white guy"") that it was the old ""make the gringo do it"". Fast forward to last week. I've been sent to work with them again the prior day I had worked and this day they made me go dump my trailer then meet them up there. I get up there and drive around looking for them at their normal work areas for a while, then finally find them. First thing the individual asks me is what took me so fucking long. I told him I had been driving around looking for them to which he huffed, put his truck into gear and said ""fucking gringo"" as he started to drive off. This behavior continued through the day until around lunch, when this crew simply disappears. I've been sent to help them and they just leave without telling me where they are going. So I waste a good amount of time driving around looking for them and I finally find them and start working(me and another co-worker who had been sent up there with them(also a white guy)). We went back to doing what we where doing before lunch and at some point they just left us again, without any word. At this point I've had enough and I decide we would just work on our own and I would talk to my boss about it at the end of the day. About 20-30 minutes into working by boss pulls up and starts yelling at both of us not to work so close together because we ""look like butt buddies"". He then tells us that we need to go help the other crew or we will be fired. I started to tell him that I refuse to continue working with that crew and to continue being called a gringo when he cuts me off and threatens that if I don't go back to work with them he would fire me. I told him ""well you can fire me"" to which he replied ""fine"" then asked me for the keys to my truck. He then preceded to force the other co-worker to go back and work with the other crew and left me stranded in another town. 
The day following I was told that I needed to sign some price of paper when I went to pick up my check. This paper stated that I had quit and that my ""final pay had been explained to me"" even though I was yet to receive my final pay(the check I was picking up was for the week prior)

I have tried to contact the companies HR(they are a huge company) and was told they don't even have an HR. I've contacted the Nevada equal rights commission and filed a report with them and am currently waiting for word back from a lawyer. Until then I was hoping for some guidance as to what else should be done. Is there a better agency to contact than the Nevada equal rights commission? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. 


Tl;dr was repeatedly being called a gringo at work and was fired when I refused to continue working with them.",0
"[Pittsburgh] Landlord is threatening to cut power and keep security deposit if I don't move out a month before my lease ends. September of last year my roommate and I signed a lease for an apartment in Bloomfield. Communication with the landlord up to this time has been sparse to nonexistent (he has NEVER responded to a maintenance request and I still do not have a key to my mailbox after sending multiple inquiries), and additionally the apartment was damaged when we moved in (stains on carpet, peeling wallpaper, holes in window screen). Our lease runs until 1PM on August 30th.

In March he asked if we would be renewing our lease and, since we were both deeply dissatisfied with the overall experience, we told him we would be seeking housing elsewhere for the following year, and he began listing and showing the apartment.

We did not hear from him again until May 15th. He told us that he had sold the apartment to renters ""would like to get in earlier, perhaps as much as a month earlier"" (I'm quoting his email to me and my roommate directly). Neither of us had settled on housing yet (we were both actively looking for apartments, but, you know. It's Pittsburgh.) so both told him we couldn't give him a concrete move-out date and would let him know ASAP.

On June 6th, he talked to me in person and I gave him the same answer. He claims he also talked to my roommate, although my roommate cannot recall if this happened for sure. Late last month, my roommate and I had both signed leases for new apartments - the earliest possible move-in date for his August 3rd, mine August 5th. I emailed our landlord with these dates and asked if we could pay only a portion of the rent for August since we would be out in the first week. Much like every other email either of us has sent to him, we never heard a response.

Last week (July 6th), he sent an email demanding that we vacate the apartment entirely by August 1st, as the new renters would be moving in. Obviously this came as a shock to both of us. One of my family members is a lawyer, so I sent her a copy of my lease and screencaps of all relevant email communications with the landlord. She agreed that this was illegal, and sent my landlord an email telling him as much (but in formal legalese). I also got in touch with the renters and explained the situation - they told me they were as shocked as I was, because they didn't want to move in early; rather, the apartment had been *advertised* as being open August 1st, and they had not yet signed a lease. Lawyer relative advised me and my roommate not to have any further communication without her input.

Landlord calls me today angrily demanding an explanation. (As I said my lawyer relative advised I stop communicating, but) I told him what I'd already told him - that I couldn't be out any earlier than August 5th. He gave me the same ultimatum - that I had to be out by August 1st, or he would cut power and service to the apartment. Additionally he says he will keep our security deposit if we are not out.

tl;dr Shitty landlord is trying to force me and my roommate out 30 days before my lease ends; lawyer has confirmed this is illegal and told landlord so, but landlord persists.

These are my questions:

1. Should I be preparing to go to court? Lawyer is family, so she wrote the email to my landlord for free. Should I look into hiring a lawyer?

2. Is it legal for a landlord to retain a security deposit for reasons other than damage to the apartment?

3. If it is illegal for him to retain the deposit (as I said, there was damage to the apartment before we moved in, and I have no doubt he will blame us for it if he can), can I demand receipts from the landlord as proof that the security deposit went toward repairing the apartment?

"Tulsa, OK Guy did a hit and run and gave me fake insurance info.. The incident happened because he cut me off and braked instantly. There was only a foot of a distance between my cars front and his trucks rear after he instantly merged into my lane. So when he hit the brakes I only had a split second to brake. I couldn't brake all the way and managed to hit him. My radiator broke and the cars balance is weird do to the impact. I wish I had a dash cam, but I never thought I'd need it... After the hit, he didn't stop, he tried to run away and ended up driving into a dead end street. Where he quickly got out of his truck and yelled that it was fine. And got back into his truck to try and leave. I yelled at him to look at what he did to my car. That's when he pulled beside me with. I told him we didn't have to involve his insurance if he paid me cash, since he looked scared. As I know how his insurance bill would increase. I asked for his number and called it. After they I told him I have to go to class and proceeded to go turn off my car incase the damage to my car was bad. He then gassed it. Idk if he ran or mistook it for a conversation end. I wasn't gonna be late for class. So I quickly hit the gas a couple of times to see if my car sounded well enough to get me to class. It's imperative that I never miss a college class lecture otherwise I will fail. After class I called him multiple times and he wouldn't answer. Until he I told him I would report him to the police. He then said I'm he was at work, which is a lie. Because when I was him he was dressed in trailer trash clothes. The incident happened around 5:30pm and I called him after class at 8pm. So I called him at 10 which is when he said he would 'get out of work'. He said he spoke to his wife and wants me to give him my insurance info as if he was the one who's to make the claim. I then said my insurance was expired. But I read on forums where  lawyers say that if you aren't at fault it shouldn't matter. I told him to give me his info. He said his name was ... and that his insurance was progressive. I said I would call his insurance and then. Told him to text me his policy number. When I called the insurance couldn't pull up anyone with that name or insurance policy. But said an investigator from their insurance company would call me next morning. He did and he asked more details about the incident. They also couldn't get ahold of him as he wouldn't answer his phone. I gave them his number when the fake info he gave me that same night. I then texted him saying to send me a picture of his state ID and insurance info to make a claim to his real insurance and would file a report if he didn't. He then proceeded to avoid it by saying I didn't have any insurance and the police would laugh at me, because no matter what who ever gets rear ended is innocent he said. I filed the report and later that after noon. The investigator said, he finally got ahold of him and that he wouldn't give any info about him other than that his insurance wasn't progressive, he had a ford-150 and that my car already was damaged before the incident. Which is total bs. He lied about everything. And then had the nerve to text me saying his tired of this shit and that his lawyer wouldn't press charges for harassment if I texted him again. I know it's a bluff, because he's a liar and just wants to get away with it. I haven't been called by the police. But if I someone get the calls from my service provider as evidence along with my texts. I should win and have him lay for my cats damages right? I'm a poor college student. And can't drive my car anymore since he broke my radiator. And I have another class lecture this Monday. He never asked me to lay for his damaged rear since he knows he was at fault. But is this Enough info for me to win this case? Thanks",0
"[OR/AZ] A friend and I had a falling out, now they're threatening a source of my income.. Hey there /r/legaladvice. Using a throwaway here.

Around February of this year I was contacted by a friendly acquaintance I had known for years asking me if they could stay with me for a convention in the area that we would both be vendors at. I told them that sure, they could, and I had no problem with it. Convention comes and goes, and then about a week afterwards there was some fallout and we decided to go our separate ways. 

The fallout had nothing to do with the convention but of a personal matter. 

This person made it clear in no uncertain terms that they didn't want to have anything to do with me anymore, and I respected that wish and never contacted them again. 

I've never once talked about this person online, blasting them, or even ""vaguebooked"" about them.

During the time this was happening, and every few weeks like clockwork, this person would send me some very nasty texts and emails, commenting on what a horrible person I was, etc. I never replied (in kind or at all) and just let them rant and rave. It finally died down a bit until this last week.

Here's where the income thing comes in. 

We're both members of a fairly niche convention circuit. There's about half a dozen shows over the next few months we're both supposed to be vendors at. As far as I was concerned, the matter was closed; I sell my stuff, you sell yours, and we have the professionalism to ignore each other and get on with our lives.

Two days ago I got a very long text message filled with more ""commentary"" and a threat that if this person sees me at the next show, that ""there will be trouble."" I have no intention of interacting with this person and I finally broke my silence and emailed them, stating that I had no desire to have anything to do with them, but I wasn't going to cancel my spots at the next few shows just because they were going to be there. I also stated that they were not to contact me again, and if they did, I would consider it harassment and do what I needed to legally protect myself. I blocked this person on all social media, blocked their email, and blocked their number from my phone. 

I got over this whole thing months ago, and I've already moved on from it chalking it up to a lesson learned.

This morning I have a few showrunners for this next event and a few after it contact me to ""get my side of the story"" because this person is now reaching out to them saying they feel threatened by me. In short, they're trying to get me booted as a vendor from these shows. If this happens, I stand to lose a lot of speculative income, and I'll lose the very *real* income of the thousands of dollars I've paid to secure my spot at these shows.

This person has more ""pull"" in the circuit than I do. They've been doing it for a few years and I've only been doing it for a little over one, and upon doing some digging, they have indeed gotten people banned from shows. I don't know the circumstances behind those, but I do know it's been done.

I'm unsure what to do here. I've taken a lot of written abuse from this person (all of which I've saved) off and on for months now but simply let it roll off my back because I've had other things to focus on and I never made any reply to any of it until the email I sent last night.

This convention circuit is a source of secondary income for me but it is the *only* income this person gets. I'm not trying to get this person banned from any shows ""before they get me banned"" because I absolutely *do not* want their income to be affected. I was willing to let all the verbal abuse go, but now this person is seriously making threats that could affect my income.

I just want to be able to sell my stuff in peace. That's all.

What are my options here? I'm in AZ, this person is in OR.",0
"Filing for disability and paying for it. Hey everyone~ using a throwaway account for this. Please let me know if this is the right place to post or if there's a similar post I may reference. 

So I became disabled recently (off the clock) and found out I'll need surgery which would leave me immobile for the next 2-3 months, and won't return to an active lifestyle for another 8 months. Because my job is high physical activity I am in the process of claiming disability and my employer has been extremely helpful. Since I also live in a walk-up in an urban area I can't access my apartment safely without supervision so I decided to stay with my mom in a different state until I can have the surgery. 

The problem is I didn't have insurance at the time of the disability so I've been having to pay out of pocket for MRI/X ray and Doctors visits to make sure I would really need surgery, out of the state I live in. My insurance kicks in next month so I'll have to wait until then to get the surgery, unless I want to pay over 10k out of pocket. I can't yet make an appointment for the surgery because I'm not insured yet, even though I will be at the time of the appointment. I get it, it's a legal issue. There are a lot of 'should haves' in this scenario and I am to blame for why this is spiraling. I'm gaining back control of the situation but it's going to be a longer process now. However, this is not where my issue is.

I went to urgent care and paid out of pocket so I could get referred for an MRI and specialist. Okay. Did that. When I saw the specialist I asked specifically if I would be able to work and how long would it be. He said absolutely not and that it would take up to 8 months to recover, post-op, back to my high activity level. My employer then suggested I file for disability. When I spoke to the office again they said they wouldn't fill out my claim because I'm not getting the surgery with them and that it could be a legal issue, however when I pressed them on why they didn't really give me a lot of information. When I spoke with my employer's insurance company they said they just needed the word on whether I could work or not, and that the surgery dates could be figured out later. 

Then, I tried going to the urgent care to see if that first Doctor could fill out my disability form (since he was the one who referred me and scheduled the MRI etc). His receptionist said that it would take up to 2-3 visits, possibly more to get the claim filled out ($150 per visit!). It's literally one sheet of paper asking if I can work. That's it. The MRI is proof enough I can't and I have my medical forms from the hospital. When I asked why she wouldn't give me an explanation, all she said was it would take time to fill out the paperwork (but doesn't know exactly how much time) and that we could see a specialist if I needed it that badly. I am at a loss. I'm in the process of finding my own specialist and surgeon in my state and that's become a wholly different issue otherwise I could've had that provider help (and will if none of this gets figured out but time is a factor with paperwork) ...

Can the hospital refuse to sign the disability papers because I'm not having the surgery with them even though they told me I will absolutely need surgery and won't be able to work?

Can the urgent care doctor ask for an unknown amount of medical visits just to fill out one piece of paper? I feel like I'm being price gouged.

I know this is my fault, yes I should've had insurance and yes I should've seen a doctor in my state immediately to start the process of finding a specialist. I really did not think my injury was  going to need surgery at the time and thought I could just heal my way out of it. I'm learning a hard lesson this month and paying out of pocket for it. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you",0
"Need advice as renter. I made an agreement to leave the property on 1 September but he contracted the property and is demanding me out 3 weeks early. Month to month lease. (VA). Hopefully I can find out my rights here. I moved into a house with my sister and brother-in-law. They signed the lease for me in my stead while I was in the hospital. I paid the entirety of the first last and security by transferring the money to my sister with my phone. When I left the hospital I moved in with their help to aid in my recovery. My sister passed away of an medicine overdose in the middle of the first lease and her husband split. My girlfriend at the time I'm married quickly in that time frame moved in with me and we signed a new lease about a month later. The lease was verbally carrying out all of the terms of the first lease, though a few things seemed off ""due to his understanding of English"", but he was friendly enough to make this accommodation. I asked about the last month and he said all the terms from the first lease were carrying over. I fulfilled this lease but both my wife and I got hit with support payments to our exes and we needed to move. We couldn't afford this place anymore. I cashed in a retirement fund to carry us until a family property was ready on the 1st of September. We verbally agreed that the lease would be carried out month-to-month from there on out. 

Back in may he told me he would be putting the house on the market in August. I told him our property wouldn't be ready until the 31st of August allowing us to move in there after. He agreed to find sympathetic tenants to what we needed but that he wanted to sign the lease before he left the country again as he is an Afghani. He asked me permission to show the property in June to a couple of families and I hesitantly agreed feeling this would keep us on even footing. Getting a house showroom-ready with three little girls and a pregnant wife is not easy but neither here nor there. While I was out of town in early July he signed a contract with one of the tenants he had shown the house to for them to move in August 15th. He is telling me I have to be out on the 10th to facilitate their move. I am sympathetic that he needs to rent a property particularly before school start but this is a heavy military area with families coming and going constantly. We had verbally agreed that I couldn't leave until the 1st of September and asked him out of Goodwill to give me two weeks to clean and move. He agreed again that would be fine he just needed to find sympathetic tenants and all would be well. 

I am still disabled from my coma and other factors from my military service. My wife is pregnant. My oldest child is 10. The only money we have is for the August rent and it would not cover the expense of hiring movers to store our stuff a hotel or even the cost of eating out for that time. Basically there is no way to move there is nowhere to go until the property opens on the 1st of September. 

This is not a slum property and we have taken wonderful care of it. The three times we received repairs from him he insistently and insultingly blamed us repeatedly for an HVAC that broke during a hurricane a screen door during the same storm and afterwards most of the area Psy huge increase end bug infestations and rat infestations and he proceeded to blame us despite an inadequate sealing around the house and a garage door window that's been broken since the day we moved in with promise after promise of repair that never came in. Our rent has been on time every month except for one month when my father passed away I was still only a few days late and he said he didn't care he just wanted it.

I apologize for the excessive details that I do not know what's relevant and what's not. I hope anyone here can help. Tldr; we're being forced to move, we can't move.",1
"Nursing student here and I'm worried another nursing student is going to do something that will affect my future career. Could I get some advice?. I made friends with a fellow nursing student about a year ago. We got along well for a most of that time until she started acting very strangely so I tried to reduce our interactions to more of an acquaintance level. I still helped her with school work and coached her through some NCLEX practice exams. I made sure to be very non-confrontational as she has mentioned all sorts of mental instability issues in the past and how she hates having any sort of direct confrontation. I have no idea if any claims about depression or anxiety are actually diagnosed.

We ended up with pretty much the SAME EXACT schedule this past semester. So naturally, we would walk to class together and occasionally go to the restroom together. Normal female things. Nothing she did gave me any cause for alarm. I never tried to bother her. I thought it was a simple, functional, school-based friendship.

This is where things get strange. She started acting very distant and would ignore about half the time when I would say hi and she started leaving class for long periods. Then she started leaving whenever I would even be in the same hall way. She'd leave class about a minute before it was over and not make eye contact with anyone. I thought maybe she was having a serious problem so I texted her to see if she was okay. If anything was wrong, etc. If I could help. I may not want to be best friends but when someone acts THAT oddly, maybe just a little compassion can change whatever situation they are in.

She assures me that everything is fine and then started ignoring me completely a few days later. I gave up on trying to figure out what was up or if I could help. I kept to myself. This was a while back.

I get a text about a week ago saying that she feels uncomfortable with how much I stalked her last semester and she didn't think it was okay for me to go to the restroom with her because she felt that I wanted an intimate relationship and would try something.

I told her I was uncomfortable with further contact after telling her it had been a while since I 'stalked' her and that the stalking she was talking about was unavoidable on both of our parts because we had five classes together in the same day. If she was following me or I her, it couldn't have been avoided but that whatever she perceived to be the case was simply us walking to class together. She was the one that showed up on campus on days that she had no classes and went to some of my classes with me (I had seven classes total that semester). I feel like if anyone should be scared of the situation, it should be me. I'm not, though. Just uncomfortable.

I'm worried that since this contact was so out of the blue and so unprovoked with specific details on how I made her feel threatened basically, that she's trying to set me up in some way. I'm genuinely worried because what if she's saying all of that and being so unpredictable because she's about to do something like file a restraining order? That would kill any future I could have as a nurse.

We are both early thirties in Nebraska if that affects regional laws.

What should I do? Save the texts and get a lawyer on retainer just in case? I don't understand why she would just now start doing all of this when we haven't really talked since last semester. This whole situation feels very wrong to me. I know she's a very good manipulator which is one of the main reasons I stopped associating with her so much. This all just feels too odd and specific to mean anything good.

**TL;DR-** Ex-class mate from last semester texts me out of the blue saying that she feels like I was stalking her. Why bring this up now, without ever indicating that feeling before? What should I do to protect myself and my future?",0
"[South Carolina] I was groomed, abused, and abandoned starting when I was 17 by a 27M. Today I found a video. So I met this guy when I was 17 (a couple months away form 18). He essentially groomed me and offered me xanax and alcohol and a place to stay when I was homeless. We got very intoxicated and passed out and when I regained consciousness is when the video takes place. I didn't know that I had this video in my possession and uncovered it when I was trying to clear space off my laptop. The video depicts the following:

&gt; Both of us are naked. We're playing around with my new camera phone and seeing how long it will take video. I am acting like a drunk 17 year old. Both of us are clearly identifiable in the video. There isn't any sexual intercourse in the video however I do reference sex with him and at one point in the video I say ""I am 17 and you are 27. I did not consent to this and you are making child porn."" From the video it looks like I was holding the phone most of the time excepting the couple times he tries to grab it and film me naked. It also appears as though he might be taking pictures or recording simultaneously on his phone. 

Later on in our relationship I found a hard drive with a BUNCH of pornographic pictures and highly sexual conversations with people that he had never had relationships with. It was very clear he was suffering from a sexual addiction. Our initial contact led to a two-ish year ""relationship"" that ended in him abandoning me the day before my birthday. During this time he was highly abusive about my appearance and weight. We moved to the outer banks and lived there, away from my family, friends, or any acquaintances. When he abandoned me he managed to pack up all of our valuable possessions while he sent me a couple hours away to get my nails done for my birthday and then moved cross-country to California with his business partner without notice. This included walking out on our recently co-signed car which he purchased using the entirety of my savings. I was left with a large number of animals to care for including reptiles, fish, dogs, and cats. Immediately and with precision he

1. cancelled all our joint accounts
2. blocked me on all social media
3. set up a forwarding address
4. blocked my phone number
5. gave notice to the landlord that *both* of us would be moving out immediately

It was obviously premeditated.

Even after he left he started talking to me again a few months later. He initiated sexual exchanges over skype and email pictures (because he refused to text me). He played games and led me along emotionally and then ask for a bunch of nudes. He would even mention the idea of coming back and ""visiting."" He later went on to get caught masturbating at work (by no intent of mine) while sending it to me and ceased communication after he was fired.

To this day I haven't really been in a position to take any action against him and for years I've been too emotional traumatized to see the situation clearly. When I found the video and watched it I was disgusted by how childish and intoxicated I was and am moved to take action. I feel violated, lied to, and really this event has turned my life upside down. My credit is still destroyed by the repossession and have daily anxiety.

I'm ready to take action against him. I feel like I was a minor who was very intentionally groomed. Where do I start? I currently reside in Oregon and he is located in California (I have a last known address and I can track him down). Can I report him to the police where the video was taken and will they likely take any action? I was 17 and underage (although within a couple months of 18) but clearly was groomed, given substances, and taken advantage of by a much older individual. We are both married now, this isn't a revenge thing. I don't want anything except for him to accept some kind of consequence for his wrongdoings. Thank you.",0
"[ME] I've been running a Ghost Analysis team and now I'm worried about the drawbacks. Good morning all,

I've never been a big believer in ghosts. I believe in the afterlife, but not ghosts.

About a year ago I saw a post on Craigslist looking for a ""Supernatural tester"" to come to a womans house and test if it was haunted. She said she required some evidence of legitimacy to be hired. So I printed out a license that stated I was licensed to ""Ghoul Inspect"" by the United Paranormal Hunting Association(UPHA). Technically, this is true. But I had started UPHA about an hour after I saw the CL posting. So I licensed myself. 

Anyway, I went to the (obviously not) ""haunted house"" and looked around. I said that there were no ghosts and only took half of what she offered(She offered $300 so I took $150). I figured this was a win/win/win in a kind of scumbag way but at the same time the girl said the other people who emailed wanted $900 and she *was going to pay it*. Plus she would have been told they were real.

Anyway, so I realized how amazing this is for money, so I did it to other people, all while making the operation look more and more legitimate. 

At my best after bringing in two friends to help, I made $1700 from 12 people in a single week for about 10 hours worth of work. 

Anyway so this is one of the two cases that worries me. 

The first is this:

So about 3 months ago I met this Super Atheist and she lived with an older lady(Her aunt). Her aunt was quite wealthy(they own a local business in a ritzy part of Maine, you'd know it if you lived there) and she had inherited it. The aunt basically bankrolls this young girl. The Aunt was convinced she was being haunted by a ghost, but she didn't know who(though she had a few ideas which I won't divulge because of privacy). So the younger girl(Sara) wouldn't agree to call the more expensive ""paranormal investigators"" but called me because I charge $150 for initial investigations, and that was worth it to put the issue to rest. 

So I went there, and here is the thing, I said the house *was* haunted. I needed the return business. I'm not proud, but I did some bad things. I moved items when they were in the bathroom, at one point I took a recorder and stuck it in her ACHV unit to make screaming/moaning noises. All in all, I'm a terrible person and I admit that. 

Anyway, the woman passed and I went over to the house of Sara and said how sorry I am.

But Sara was now convinced that the house was haunted. I know how bad this is because this girl is an atheist with a near ivy-league degree in a STEM Field. My practice *really* fucked her up. 

Not knowing what to do, I doubled down. 

I did just about the worst thing I'd ever done and I took the spare key to the house she gave me and I paid a man to wait in the basement when she came home and then act as scary as possible(he also stole a painting, but I didn't tell him to do that). I thought he would just like pound the walls and then I could say we caught him and the ghost is gone, your aunt is at peace etc etc etc.

Instead this fucking idiot straight up ran after making some screaming noises in the basement and the *GIRL WAS HOME*. I mean he ran out of the basement, and she was him! She got scared out of her mind and then called me.

So I ditched it. I ended the whole practice, changed my number, etc. The ""address"" was just a PO box so I stopped paying for it.

That concerns me but it's on the backburner.

The second one is what worries me.

So after a few weeks had passed I got the service going on the DL and some girl said she needed help. Yadda yadda yadda, I did the standard procedure while mentioning that her daughter might be experiencing some hauntings.

This stupid bitch went out and paid for a $4,900 unofficial exorcism by an unlicensed priest!

So I don't know what to do. What if she comes after me? I never said to do that! Am I in the legal right here? Do I double down and endorse the exorcism?",0
"[MD] A vehicle titling cluster****. I know I shouldn't have bought this car in the first place, first car I bought on my own, didn't know any better then, etc...

tl;dr: private seller misrepresented title, it was actually not in his name, I was able to contact the legal owner of the car and explain the situation to him, he understood and agreed to help resolve it, and failed to do so/lied about doing so on multiple occasions.

Full story:
I bought a used car for 2 grand off a private seller (no dealership involved). Essentially the title was misrepresented at the time of sale, it wasn't in his name, but in the name of the previous owner. The seller had bought the car from the owner, who he knew as a cousin or something like that, and never titled it in his (the seller's) name. He did have the title document and gave it to me. The sale section on the back of the title was filled out in such a way that neither I nor the seller could transfer the title to one of our names. I also got a bill of sale to verify that cash had exchanged hands (at least some paper trail). 

The locations of everything play a big part in the rest of the story: I live in MD. The seller lives in VA. The owner of the car lives in TX.

I worked with the seller to try and solve this in various ways, through trying the VA abandoned vehicle process, contacting the legal owner of the car in TX, and none of that worked out. The owner of the car said he would get a title copy and write it out in my name, but never did. The seller then paid a small dealership in VA to process the car through the abandoned vehicle process. They said that they had experience resolving title issues like this, and they could at least give me temporary plates to drive the car in the meantime. Fast forward several months (yes) of delays and ""it'll be ready in a couple weeks"", the dealership suddenly closes up without a warning, due to zoning rights issues or something.

A week or two after that, I call around a few lawyers to try and figure out what my rights are, or if anyone can help me out. Even the lawyers who work with auto titles don't have much of an answer for me. Lawyers in MD tell me it's in VA jurisdiction since that is where the sale occurred. VA lawyers tell me that I need to pressure the legal owner of the car. One unofficially told me that what the owner of the car is doing is considered fraud, since he is aware of the situation, and is allowing someone else (seller) to sell a car that is under his (owner) name and not resolving it.

I reach the owner and tell him this and he says he is unable to travel to the DMV, but will send a form in to have a title copy mailed. The limit for how long that should take, with processing and shipping times, is about 3 weeks later. That passed a couple days ago. I also was just able to reach the TX DMV and ask about the status of the title request. They never received a form. They also informed me that if the owner goes into the DMV, he will get a title copy on the spot, no waiting period.

So now I'm past giving either the seller or owner any more time or patience, and am trying to find a lawyer to at the very least send an official letter, probably to the owner. I haven't had luck getting a lawyer with a solid answer or consultation in VA. I am planning to call both the VA Bar and the TX Bar referral services, and explain this to them, and hopefully get a bit more direction, and at most a consultation with a lawyer experienced enough in this area. I don't even know where to start cold-calling lawyers in TX aside from that. Not to mention almost no free time during business hours to call either of those, between school and work.

So aside from calling the Bar referral services... what the hell do I do now? From what some lawyers have told me, the legal fees would exceed the money spent on the car, and that's money I don't have. It would almost be cheaper to just fly down to TX and drag the owner to the DMV, but there's many reasons why that couldn't really happen easily.",0
"[EU]Language school trying to avoid me after their mistake?. I (EU citizen) moved to another EU country a while back and been learning their language for some years now. I changed the language school recently (end 2016) to be closer to my home and they informed me I can get B2 diplom before summer holiday which is great for me because I wanted to go to univercity here.

However due to (what I believe is their) mistake I am not able to do the exams in time and now I got to wait a whole year before I can apply for univercity. 

Where did the mistake come from? Well when I switched to this new school I'll addmit my speaking was not the greatest however I had gotten a paper from the other school that I can be in a class where people learn to become B2 level, but they simply made me take their school test and marked me as level A2. For 2 months I was in a group where I felt I was not growing at all. I had 2 other classmates that were aiming to have B2 level and were about same level as me. Rest were complete beginners.

Here comes my biggest problem. Basically the teacher felt I was ready for the B2 books but the 2 other students were almost done with their B1 books so I needed to wait for them. 

Second problem was that I was promised classic lessons (teacher teaches everyone) but instead we were divided into THREE groups and teacher jumped between all of them. To us tho, the least. Because to become B2 you need to work a lot on your own aperently. But what am I paying for? To speak with people that are just as bad in the language as me and there is no one to correct us? I can also work alone at home and not come to school at all. 

It took 2 months to sort this situation to better but not ideal. I got a different teacher but the group situation remaind. Now instead of having 3 different groups we have 2. There is a lot more classical lessons but I still feel the tempo for us who wants to become B2 is slowed down due to the people who are aimimg to become B1.

After not bein fully satisfied I wrote a complaint e-mail to them and got no answer for a month and I sent a reminder but still got no answer for over half a year. 

The reason I sent a second reminder is because I realised I needed to extend my contract for 2 extra month to be ready for exams... 2 months that I lost in the beginning.

They responded with that they do not understand what I am complaining about because they sorted the problem (havin 2 different language level groups in one group instead of 3) and therefor do not undernstand what I want.

After mentioning the money wasted for the 2 months they now want to schedule a meeting with the teacher I had for 2 months. Yes i gave the times I'm available but I feel like they are completely dodging the fault they made not the teacher. Yes it was wrong of my teacher to say I need to work on my own for most of the time. BUT it is NOT the teachers fault of having so many students of so many different language levels.

I am afraid of getting an ""enemy"" that is not suppose to be my enemy. The teacher made mistakes but the biggest problems came from the school itself and every email I've gotten from them is so passive and not acknowledging anything and just blaming it on someone else.

What should I do in the meeting? What should I be prepared for? I will definetly make preperations of all problems I have with them (this isn't the only one) but my biggest fear is that I can not stand my ground because I have to do it in THEIR language. I was wondering of asking to record the conversation but I can understand if the teacher that is dragged into this doesn't want to be recorded. What should I do then?

My apologies if this isn't the correct subreddit. Just point me to the right direction and I'll post it there instead.

Tl;dr: language school made me waste 2 months. Missed applying to univercity because I couldn't do language exams on time due to wrong class placement. School makes me have meeting with them and the teacher. Teacher very little at fault. What should I do during the meeting?",0
"Signed a contract for a web service. Its not good. They send me contradictory emails and say its $1500 to cancel. [BC, Canada + New Jersey]. Hi,

Thank you guys for taking the time to read this and help us out, we messed up! My girlfriend and I run a small business in BC, Canada. We needed scheduling software and she ended up going with a web platform she used to use at an old job, however, we really dont like it at all and we havent used it, but its costing us 100$ a month! The web service company is based out of New Jersey. Is there anything we can do to get out of this contract or break it by paying less than what they are asking?

 I know Canada has some consumer protection laws, but I dont know if they are applicable in this situation. I've provided more details below:

She signed a 24 month contract and when we asked the company how to cancel they transferred us on the phone several times before saying they couldnt help us and then it took a few days before they finally emailed us the cancellation information. **To cancel the contract we would have to buy out our remaining term and pay them for all 24 months anyway**. 

The communcation with the company has been awful, they emailed us completely incorrect information about our contract and how long it is then in the same email attached the actual contract she signed with the correct information. **In the email they say we signed the contract in 2014 when it was actually 2016 and the actual contract shows 2016 too .

"Guy basically did a hit and run on my car. Only managed to obtain his number before he sped off. Idk how to post more pics on this post. I have messages of him sending me false insurance info to avoid paying for damages. And is threatening to sue me for harassment, if I continue to ask him for it. The incident happened because he cut me off and braked instantly. There was only a foot of a distance between my cars front and his trucks rear after he instantly merged into my lane. So when he hit the brakes I only had a split second to brake. I couldn't brake all the way and managed to hit him. My radiator broke and the cars balance is weird do to the impact. I wish I had a dash cam, but I never thought I'd need it... After the hit, he didn't stop, he tried to run away and ended up driving into a dead end street. Where he quickly got out of his truck and yelled that it was fine. And got back into his truck to try and leave. I yelled at him to look at what he did to my car. That's when he pulled beside me with. I told him we didn't have to involve his insurance if he paid me cash, since he looked scared. As I know how his insurance bill would increase. I asked for his number and called it. After they I told him I have to go to class and proceeded to go turn off my car incase the damage to my car was bad. He then gassed it. Idk if he ran or mistook it for a conversation end. I wasn't gonna be late for class. So I quickly hit the gas a couple of times to see if my car sounded well enough to get me to class. It's imperative that I never miss a college class lecture otherwise I will fail. After class I called him multiple times and he wouldn't answer. Until he I told him I would report him to the police. He then said I'm he was at work, which is a lie. Because when I was him he was dressed in trailer trash clothes. The incident happened around 5:30pm and I called him after class at 8pm. So I called him at 10 which is when he said he would 'get out of work'. He said he spoke to his wife and wants me to give him my insurance info as if he was the one who's to make the claim. I then said my insurance was expired. But I read on forums where  lawyers say that if you aren't at fault it shouldn't matter. I told him to give me his info. He said his name was ... and that his insurance was progressive. I said I would call his insurance and then. Told him to text me his policy number. When I called the insurance couldn't pull up anyone with that name or insurance policy. But said an investigator from their insurance company would call me next morning. He did and he asked more details about the incident. They also couldn't get ahold of him as he wouldn't answer his phone. I gave them his number when the fake info he gave me that same night. I then texted him saying to send me a picture of his state ID and insurance info to make a claim to his real insurance and would file a report if he didn't. He then proceeded to avoid it by saying I didn't have any insurance and the police would laugh at me, because no matter what who ever gets rear ended is innocent he said. I filed the report and later that after noon. The investigator said, he finally got ahold of him and that he wouldn't give any info about him other than that his insurance wasn't progressive, he had a ford-150 and that my car already was damaged before the incident. Which is total bs. He lied about everything. And then had the nerve to text me saying his tired of this shit and that his lawyer wouldn't press charges for harassment if I texted him again. I know it's a bluff, because he's a liar and just wants to get away with it. I haven't been called by the police. But if I someone get the calls from my service provider as evidence along with my texts. I should win and have him lay for my cats damages right? I'm a poor college student. And can't drive my car anymore since he broke my radiator. And I have another class lecture this Monday. He never asked me to lay for his damaged rear since he knows he was at fault. But is this Enough info for me to win this case? Thanks",0
"Just how much power does a Rights Grant and Release give a company? Or, does a company now own my dog?. Background:
I have a Pembroke Welsh Corgi that is starting to become popular on various social media sites including Instagram. Earlier this week a well-known pet toy/treat subscription service, let's call them Park Box, approached me and asked if they could use one of his videos in some marketing/promotional material. In order to do so I need to sign a Rights Grant and Release (full text below).

I don't have a lawyer and I am hoping to get some general advice or some answers to my questions:

1. Does Park Box now own the likeness of my dog?

2. What if another company approaches me and wants to use him in something like a commercial or calendar, is that ok?

3. If I made any materials using a photo or video of him, and sold them, would I get sued?

4. Does this release cover only this video or ALL videos/images/recordings?

I would love for my dog to get more exposure but I don't want to sell his soul to do it.

Full text of release:

"Master's Degree - Supervisor Harassment/Abuse of Power [LONG POST]. I am writing this post on behalf of a friend who I know very well and has found himself in a frustrating predicament and is in need of some advice.
Background Story: My friend obtained a grant to carry out and complete a Master's dissertation in Chemistry which he has to finish by September or else risk having to pay the grant himself, which he cannot afford. 
What Happened: My friend was assigned to a completely new tutor/supervisor, lets call her Dr. Smith for simplicity's sake. This is Dr. Smith's first year working at University and is thus supervising her first two students who she is being abusive against.
The problem first started when my friend cordially disagreed with Dr. Smith on how a particular calculation should be worked out - a classical example of a student not agreeing with his teacher and the teacher taking it completely the wrong way (the displacement defense mechanism). 
The latter is just the tip of the iceberg, on several occasions she has called my friend 'stupid' to his face (and even his colleague) in an aggressive tone. Her personality is what I would describe as toxic and straight out abusive. It got to a point where my friend had to be careful of everything that he does, says or asks because of a possible tantrum by Dr. Smith.
This took a toll on my friend so he approached Dr. Smith and told her that she was being too aggressive and was intimidating him. Once again Dr. Smith took it completely wrong, not only was she completely oblivious to how abusive she has been but she accused my friend of being aggressive, not working hard enough and at times, intimidating her. Now I know my friend really well and if I had to describe him I would say that he's extremely passive, smart and hardworking so her accusations genuinely dumbfounded me.
My friend realized that his chat clearly got him nowhere and made things a lot worse. Knowing that he needs Dr. Smith to complete his Master's degree, my friend decided to take the higher road and ""suck up"" to his supervisor so he sent her an apology email, hoping that if he would be the first to reach out and make a compromise to settle their differences Dr. Smith would TRY to do the same. WRONG, she did not even read his email and they got to a point where Dr. Smith kicked him out of the lab and told him that she is not going to work with him anymore.
At this point, my friend is not completely screwed as she won't let him complete his dissertation so he setup a meeting with the faculty Dean to explain things to him which was unfruitful as she ended up 'hijacking' his meeting and turn it into a scolding session against him. 
With no options left he decided to setup a meeting with the disciplinary board and he explained his case quite well in privacy this time and was quite convincing. Dr. Smith also had a meeting with the board and used my friend's apology email as leverage to falsely prove her point. It seems like the disciplinary board is more inclined to believe Dr. Smith because the apology email demonstrated my friend’s guilt (from their point of view) rather than the fact that he was willing to take the higher road as he is in need off of his tutor (however crazy she is).

My question now is, if the disciplinary board decided to side with Dr. Smith, what else can my friend do or who else should he turn to? The situation that he's in is not only unjust because he's going to be robbed of a Master's degree which he's so close to finishing but also because he will have to pay for the grant that he worked so hard to obtain, all because of a person who has personality issues and is good at hiding it/lie about it during disciplinary meetings.
Should he find a legal advisor or attorney considering that he’s broke? Does he stand a chance in tribunal or court? Is taking legal action even worth it?

I apologize for posting such a long post, I did not realize that it was going to be this long and I am sincerely very grateful for any advice whatsoever as none of his friends seem to be able to think of a way to help him, hence why I am here.",0
"Advice needed my CANADIAN (Ontario) wife just left me and I think she wants to come after my possessions and assets in New Zealand.. This is going to be long so thanks for reading in advance

My wife (Canadian) and I got married in Toronto in May 2016. She insisted that we go live with her wealthy family in the middle east in Jordan after we got married. She was already working for her dad and he wanted to keep her from leaving the office so he promised me work and business opportunity. His promises turned to be flat out lies, I realised after 6 months of working for him that he is not going to pay a cent. Furthermore, my wife demanded an expensive wedding, a whole heap of jewellery and a honeymoon that I paid for (approximately 200K total cost). He had discussed wedding expenses with me when we got engaged and he said that he would help, he also said that he would organise the honeymoon and that it would be a surprise for us. He did nothing and it all turned out to be empty talk. 

After almost 10 months of living with in laws in the middle east in a country where I had no visa, no work permit, and no driver’s license. I had enough so I decided to go back to my home country in New Zealand so that I can go back to work, get out of the middle east and start earning a living again. My wife reluctantly joined me and we have been in NZ for almost 3 months. I started a new job and we are living at my family’s house till we can look at purchasing our own place. I came back from work on Tuesday only to find that all the jewellery is gone, her stuff is gone and she is uncontactable. There were Auckland airport charges on my bank statement on the day that she left. I couldn’t get hold of her but I managed to speak to her dad who told me that she was depressed in NZ and she is on a plane back to Canada. I tried contacting her but she didn’t pick up or return my text messages. I knew she was unhappy here but never expected that she would do something like this. We never had an argument, she didn’t have to do a thing at home as I did the shopping, cooking and laundry. We had a cleaner come in once a week and she just stayed in bed on her laptop watching soaps and going once a week to get her nails done. I never touched or abused her physically or anything like that. 

Our total time together as a married couple was 14 months. We don’t have any kids and its very unlikely that she is pregnant. We mostly lived at her parent’s place and at my parents for a couple of months. I do own a rental property that is rented as an investment and have some money saved in the bank both of these I bought pre marriage. I earned a total of $2000 dollars from working 2 weeks in NZ while I was with her. She never earned a cent as she just used her dad’s credit card to shop while we lived in the middle east. She has an apartment in the middle east that her dad bought for us and put it in her name but we only lived in it for 6 weeks before we left to go to NZ. 

This is where I need your help reddit, I don’t know anything about Canadian law or how it works. However I would appreciate it if you can help please. Do you think she can come after my property here, take away my money or make any other demands? She left me last week and she is not willing to communicate. Even if she was depressed after what she did I don’t think I can ever trust her or get back with her. She is very materialistic, she took all the jewellery even a gold cross that my mum gifted to me when I was 16 for my first communion. For some reason she feels entitled to everything I have yet she never earned a cent as she always worked for her dad. Any suggestions please if there is something I need to do to protect my assets in NZ, I don’t own anything in Canada and I am not a resident or have any immigration status there. 

TL:DR Canadian wife walked out on my after 14 months and may try to fleece me for money (no kids involved). We didn’t have a family home as we stayed at in laws place mostly and I didn’t work during this time. Is she entitled to anything? What can I do to protect my assets in New Zealand?",0
"[Dallas, TX] Our apartment is dragging their feet on maintenance, and I want out.. I apologize for the long ass post. I wanted to try and get all the relevant details in about my predicament.

I moved into my current apartment a little over a year ago, and my current lease is up in November 2017. My boyfriend also lives with me and is a co-tenant on the lease. The complex has been decent so far and has usually been prompt in regards to maintenance requests. My main issue only started a few weeks ago.

A few weekends ago, I came home to find that my sink and dishwasher were backing up with water. It was so bad that water had begun to seep out the front door. We contacted the emergency maintenance around 10:30 that night, and even though someone called to say that the maintenance manager would meet with us that night, no one ever came. For good measure, I also put in an online maintenance request, which seems to be about the only way this complex will take your problems seriously. A maintenance person did come out the next day, and at the time it seemed the issue has been resolved.  

The next week, water started to back up in the sink again. The kitchen didn't quite flood like it had the last time, but we were still concerned. My boyfriend called the leasing office a few times directly about the issue, and no one was ever sent out. Then, on June 30th, our air conditioner went out. Texas is having a bought of 100 degree weather right now, so our apartment has been at a constant temperature of about 80 degrees. It's kinda of livable with a fan on, but not really my preference. On June 1st, I put in an online maintenance request for both the air conditioning and the plumbing. 

On July 5th, maintenance came by while my boyfriend and I were at work, and a window ac unit was installed in the bedroom. The way it was installed in the window makes it to where our bedroom basically has no privacy. There's not really an room for a curtain to be hung up; we have vertical blinds that were installed by the complex. Because of how long the blinds are and where the unit is placed, the blinds are basically parted so that anyone can peek into the bedroom. For now, I've tacked up a blanket to cover the window just to get some privacy. 

That same night, the dishwasher flooded AGAIN. We put in a second pending work order online since the complex seems content to ignore phone calls. We didn't hear back from anyone until July 7th. My boyfriend was home from work that day and a maintenance worker, who supposedly was fixing the AC, came by and asked for access to the breaker box. My boyfriend asked if maintenance had been notified about the second plumbing issue as well, and the worker said that no one had told him anything about it, and that we should call the office (which we've already done!!!)

So right now, I have no central AC, a bedroom with an ac unit and no privacy, an 80 degree living room (because the air from the ac unit doesn't reach in there), I have a plastic tub full of dirty ass water that's leaking from my kitchen fixtures, and another tub full of dirty dishes that we can't wash because doing so will probably cause another flood of biblical proportions. 

So getting to the nitty gritty legal stuff. my lease states that the ""unlawful early move-out and reletting charge"" is $600. The lease that we signed just uses the form provided by the Texas Apartment Association, which can be found here: https://www.taa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2015_Apartment_Lease_Contract_-_FINAL_1-16.pdf. Paragraph 31 states that they have an obligation to make all reasonable repairs within a reasonable amount of time. I'm wondering how long I'm supposed to play around with these people until I can just get out of this hellhole. I'm posting here to see if there might be any other legal remedies besides just eating the costs and paying to break the lease. If you have any questions for me, I'll try to answer them. Thank you for your time.

TL;DR: Apartment can't get their shit together and fix our maintenance issues. How long do they reasonable have to fix them, and is there a way out if they don't?",1
"(KY) kids dad had me served with civil summons asking for joint custody and to be the primary. Says I cannot provide a safe and stable environment. I can and have always been the primary and want to fight this. What do I do?. Okay, so, basically my kids dad had me served with a civil summons yesterday petitioning for joint custody with him being the primary.
For some backstory, we were together for 8 years, have two daughters, 5 and 7, and have been separated for four years. Never married. No prior legal agreement in place. Since we separated I have always been the primary parent. He never had them more than a couple days a week, has never paid child support, never there when I needed him, everything has always fallen on me.
We have been having issues for quite awhile now. He has always been very unreliable. Doesn't pick them up when he says he will, doesn't answer calls or texts, never says when he'll drop them off, will be set off by the most random things and threaten to keep them and not give them back. From July to October of last year all of this kept escalating. My oldest picked up lice from school and gave it to me and her sister and he berated me for being ""filthy,"" refused to give my kids back but eventually relented and gave them to my mom after insisting they had lice again after I had already treated them. They didn't. He was erratic with the days he wanted to keep them, was late getting our oldest to school and couldn't pick her up so I had to drop what I was doing to rush to get her. Eventually I stopped asking him to help me out and my mom and I worked out a more reliable  schedule because I just couldn't depend on him or trust him to help me and be a partner. This was fine for about a month until he started demanding I change my schedule so he could see them. He wouldn't work with me and I got scared so I cut off contact while I saved money for a lawyer. 
We have been back in contact for about a month now. He showed up at my moms house, said he was going to call cps on me, the cops, that I am unstable, etc. I talked to him and he told me all he wanted was visitation. I sent him a very long text outlining my issues and concerns but telling him I was more than willing to work with him and go to a mediator but I wasn't comfortable with him taking them until there was something in place. He never responded and instead had me served with this summons.
I'm calling lawyers as soon as possible to formulate a response to the summons since I only have 20 days but I guess what I am asking is what are the chances I would lose primary? I have had some missteps in my past which play into why I did not seek out a legal agreement sooner, I was a stripper which I thought would hurt me and I did mess with substances. (Nothing major like heroin or anything and I was never addicted or did anything around the girls). Now though I am steadily employed since November and have moved up quickly at my job. I have been clean from any and all drugs for almost a year. I don't smoke and I rarely drink. I have a reliable paycheck and benefits. The girls go to school in my district, I have a stable home, I've had the same boyfriend for four years and we don't even live together, I provide everything for them emotionally and financially. He has never provided support or had them more than a couple days a week in all the time we have been separated. 
I believe he's trying to file this way to get out of child support and to hurt me. He is a very manipulative, vindictive person and I know he doesn't like me standing up to him so he is going to do everything he can to drag me down. I'm afraid me cutting off contact will play against me. In his summons it sounds like he is going to go after my environment and emotional stability. What do I need to do to prove what he is asking is not in the girls best interests? What are the chances he will get what he is asking? Is there anything that will hurt me going forward and that I need to do to prepare? I am fine with working with him on the joint custody part but I absolutely do not want to lose primary. I'm scared and need some reassurance. Thank you guys.",0
"Apartment is being ""broken"" into, stealing candy, and relocking door. 3x this past week. I think it's my teenage boy neighbor.. tldr; Someone came into my apt 3 separate times this week and stole varying amounts of candy each time. Apartment may have same locks and key for various units.

Kansas City, MO. 
First off, let me start off with how my apartment building works. This is a fob entry building and you need a fob to get off any floor except the lobby. Which is why I believe it to be someone that lives in the building, namely my neighbor.

I have a roommate and we live in a small 2BR/2BA with a small entry way and living room. It's 6 regular steps to our living room, 14 to the kitchen, 15 and 17 to our rooms. I just want to show you how small it is. I came home Sunday from a 1 month trip visiting home while my roommate stayed here by herself. We have a candy bowl that I put candy in for guests and for ourselves. 

I come home and see it's half full. Two days later, it's completely empty except for two pieces of candy. I ask my roommate what she did with it all, that's a lot of candy. She said she didn't touch it and her bf didn't touch it. We're both kind of freaked out but think it's stupid that anyone would come in and steal candy and nothing else. I chalk it up to a memory lapse or maybe I have carbon monoxide poisoning and did it, etc etc. I still called the front desk to let them know it was happening and refilled the candy bowl with reese's cups and hershey's kisses. I also talked to my next door neighbor and asked if he saw or heard anything recently. He said no, sorry, and closed the door.
We just used a door jammer where even if unlocked, the door cannot be forced in. My 200lb brother couldn't even bust through it. I locked the doors and door jammed it every night until Thursday night, when I completely forgot to jam it. 

I wake up Friday morning to go to work and all the bright, orange reese's are gone. I freak out, wake up my roommate and tell her to stop fucking with me cause it's not funny anymore. She told me she was awake all night until 5am, there's no way someone came in. Then she asked me if I woke up around 3am and I said no. She had heard someone in the living room/kitchen but thought it was me getting a snack. We call the front desk again and I head off to work around 9am. 

My roommate heads off to work around 1pm and I got home around 3:30pm. Once again, the candy jar is completely empty except for the first two pieces they left the first time they stole our candy. So now they've escalated to daytime stealing. That is where I am left off night. Nothing has happened over the weekend. I called the police to report it over the phone but they want to physically come out and do a report. I went out of town and wasn't able to do it and my roommate worked all weekend. We also don't want to spook the thief because I really want to catch who is doing this. It's really freaking creepy and psychotic to just come in someones home to steal candy, just to fuck with us. 

I believe it is the teenage boy because he is only 13, can't drive, and is on summer break. He also isn't the sweetest kid ever. I've seen him throw things and yelling racist obscenities at street walkers for no reason (we share the same window wall).

I had believed that perhaps someone has a masterkey or were picking our locks but my roommate actually talked to a tenant on our floor. The tenant said that when she first moved in, her key worked on three other units. I have already contacted the owner of my unit and let him know what was up and that he needs to come change my locks.

So, my problem is two part: this must be some sort of negligence/ security issue to have same lock for multiple units and how do I go about get this thief in jail or juvie. I am afraid that he will escalate from petty stealing to something worse. I don't want anyone else caught up in this after I move out. I am already hoping to do a stakeout tonight with my gopro recording as well as sleeping in the living room. 

Thanks for sticking with the story and I apologize for my terrible writing. Any advice would be great, thanks!",1
"Fired from daycare for indicating that I'd like to let the families know about asbestos work being done on site [NY]. Hi guys. I have a lot of questions. Thank your for being well versed in insane minutiae. I did a lot of googling about this and found only bits and pieces of answers
 

**Scenario**


I am a toddler teacher at a daycare with about 70 employees and two locations, NAEYC accredited. Our location is in a very old building. Today we came in to find that the storage facility connected to the designated break area (they share a door) is undergoing asbestos abatement. All proper signage, warnings, and info packets posted. The room was blocked off with a sheet of plastic and some plywood. None of the employees were alerted, nor were the families. We were also not offered alternative locations to eat lunch. This break room stores all of the food for the children, as well as all cleaning supplies, classroom supplies, extra toys, eating utensils, and a fridge where the employees store lunch and some snacks for children are stored. My boss claims the owner of the building told her to ""keep kids out of the break area because work is being done"" but that asbestos was not mentioned.  


**Action sequence**


I am on the playground with my children speaking to another toddler teacher. I ask her if my boss is informing the families and she isn't sure. I indicate that I'm going to let them know that they should keep their children out of the designated area, as they are often in there. My boss's sister (this is it's own problem obviously) hears this and immediately texts my boss. Boss storms onto the playground, interrogating me about why I would want to tell parents about these ""chemicals"" and saying I don't know what I'm talking about, etc etc. When I immediately agreed that i would keep it to myself if she so wished, she continued. She said I just like to caused trouble, that I was a gossip, immature, strange thing like that. I mostly ignored her as I was with my kids, and holding one of them. At the end of her ranting she asked me ""Why do you even come here every day?"" I just kind of gave her a blank stare because that question made no sense to me. I reminded her that I'm putting in my two weeks notice on Friday (going to grad school) and She tells me I'm not needed and I should leave that afternoon and not return. So, humiliated and devastated, i did.

*Note: When I say boss, I refer to our assistant director, as our director is out of town. That's why i was waiting to give my notice, as the Director would return friday. The AD indicated that she was in communication with the director the whole time. I have had no luck contacting the director.*


**Questions**



*1* Does a landlord have any obligation to tell the tenants when asbestos removal is being done? Is the presence of children relevant?


*2* Does my boss have an obligation to let employees know that this work is being done? Does she have an obligation to tell the parents?


*3* Does the landlord have the responsibility of having the air tested for asbestos levels after removal? 


*3* Is there anything shady about her reasoning for firing me? I understand at will and all that, but does the safety concern change anything? 


*4* Will I be able to collect unemployment from them? 


*5* Will I find myself in legal trouble if (now that I am no longer an employee there) I let the parents I know/have contact with that there is asbestos work going on? 


I know this is a lot so I truly thank you for reading and considering. I am so lost right now and sadly no amount of googling is bringing me solid answers to these questions. Any help or insight would be incredibly appreciated. And if there are legal issues that may arise that I was unaware of, please let me know! This is turned my life right upside down. Help.

**tldr**: Asbestos abatement being done in a daycare, no one was told it was happening. I found out halfway thru the day when my coworker asked what all the cancer signs are about. Boss/acting boss fires me (allegedly with permission from real boss) for indicating that I wanted to tell the parents of the children who attend the daycare.",1
"I think what my employer is doing is illegal (New York State). I've been experiencing some problems at work and my boyfriend suggested I ask this subreddit for help. I'm a lisensed cosmetologist working in a chain salon in New York State (not New York City). There's been rumors for years that my employers do various illegal shit. One of those things was docking our hours. The rumor was that they'd would change our time clocks to remove 30 minutes for a break when no break was given. 

In my line of work it's common for hairstylists to not take a real break. When everyone is booked for the day and there's a waiting room full of people, sometimes you just keep working.

Last summer me and some coworkers found what we believe to be proof that our employers were docking our hours. When we were playing around with our new POS, we found a page that said ""Time Card Audits"". This page had entries listing everytime our manager fixed our time clock (we were at the salon at the right time, but the computer was frozen so we couldn't clock in, we accidentally clocked out for break instead of clocking out at the end of the day, etc). It also had entries with my boss' name attached to them where new time in/time outs were recorded - a  30 minute break added to the middle of the day, maybe a second break added later in the day. There were also audits recorded where it looked like my boss would move a certain girls clock in time from 8:45 to 9:00 (we usually weren't scheduled to clock in that early, but we're expected to do so to open up shop). There were nights we had to stay in the shop an hour or two past close because we were so busy, or someone got caught up on a color, and on some of those nights there was evidence that our boss would move our clock out time back to the normal closing time.

The reports spanned about 7 months if I remember correctly, and they suggested I had about 50 cumulative hours removed from my time cards.

I have been under the impression that while it's the law that an hourly worker is ALLOWED a 30 minute break, it's not required for them to take one. I was also under the impression that it's against the law for hourly workers to perform regular duties off the clock, like cut/color hair.

When my coworkers and I discovered this, they wanted to call the labor board. One girl wanted to sue the company. A few days later, when they had time to think about it, they decided against it - they were to afraid to quit/get fired. I decided not to do anything because if I got the company in trouble, my coworkers would have also been blamed (we're fairly sure our employers knew what we were doing).

A few months later my manager announced that our employers decided the new policy was, if you get a chance to eat, even if you are not clocked out for break, you are given a break. This happened one day when we ordered a pizza. I told her I thought this was stupid, shoving a slice of pizza in my face in between haircuts is not a break, and that I was pretty sure that it was against the law. The official policy was never put into place, and my manager assured me that my boss would no longer adjust our time cards.

This was probably a lie, because the other day when one of the girls opened up her time card to clock out, she had been given a break when she had never taken one. When I checked the time card audits, the log had been mostly wiped - a few irrelevant audits from the beginning of the month were all that was left.

Most of the girls I used to work with have left, and I've been looking to quit anyways, so I'm preparing to potentially go to the board with this. I have the reports from the time card audits previously mentioned printed out, as well as the mostly clean ones I found a couple days ago. Is the labor board just going to tell me I should stop wasting their time? At one point a girl I worked with years ago called them about an isolated incedent, and they told her our boss wasn't doing anything wrong, or that at least she wouldn't be able to fight them on it. Should I sue them? I really dislike these people, but I am pretty poor. Should I just quit if im gonna be all butthurt about it and leave it at that?",0
"Advice on how to report police corruption. Long and short of it is I come from a very small town.  On top of issues with the department I have going back to when I was a little girl (they mishandled my sexual assault/abuse case that or another case of corruption I'll never know)  Since school got out there's been an obvious up-tick in noise around the neighborhood.  Oddly last year wasn't bad.  This year it's non stop atv's and dirtbikes, drinking, and yelling about ""teeners"" from the front steps at 1-3 am every morning.  I called to report noise two days ago.  dispatch asked , ""When you say yelling do you mean partying and having a good time?""  I said, ""if you're asking if they're fighting no but it's 1 am and they lit fireworks off outside my two daughters windows.  He sighed and said ok, ""you wanna talk to the deputy?""  I said ""no I wanna go back to bed"" he said ""ok deputy is in route.""  

Deputy never showed.  I know because the fireworks continued and every time my daughters came back to my room freaked out and tired.   (it's worth mention that I have two years worth of video showing the same officer going to the same house in our cul-de-sac and staying for 45 mins to an hour a couple times a week.  They are no stranger to this home)  

Last night we had 7-15 rounds fired in the center of town from a fairly loud gun.  They shot from 1-1:30 then 1:40-2 they took a break and resumed shooting until 3 am.  I lost count of rounds after that.  Police never showed up to that either. 

Rewind over the last six months.  My brother in law is a crackhead.  (No joke) My MIL passed away almost 3 years ago.  Out of her passing we ended up taking the house as the sister was engaged in a lease and crackhead wouldn't pay the bills.  We let him stay in the house for two months until the eviction letter came and we had to take over.  So in lieu of house their sister said give him the truck. 

He's never changed the title, never put tabs on or insured the vehicle.  It is still registered to his late mothers name.  

this is where the corruption comes in.  He's been pulled over multiple times.  6 in the last 9 months to be exact.  over the course of three years?... countless. Every time up until recently he's called my husband to come pick him and the truck up.  He's caught driving with a suspended license (from not paying child support, has been suspended since shortly before their mom died)   The first couple times the hub went and got him.  The third time he asked the officer, ""Why don't you impound the vehicle and throw him in jail?""  (line of thinking is maybe he'll have a chance to sober up)

The officer called in a female officer for ""back-up"" and she informed him that they all know their mom died so they know he's going through a hard time.  Just take the vehicle and him home. 

He was pulled over again two weeks ago.  Still suspended ,still unpaid fines.  Police still won't impound the vehicle.  We just got a letter from the DMV here under MIL's name saying that tabs and new plates were due this year.  

My husband said we should take that letter up to the DMV and tell them the vehicle is scrapped.  

There is so much more into the corruption than just this piddly stuff however I don't know how much they can actually watch/read. 

My mom works fairly closely with police in her public position a couple of them have gone as far as telling her how they investigate.  That they can read through facebook messages without permission (legal I guess)  so I didn't want to ask her how to report as I really don't want a ""Walking Tall"" thing to go down.  

How do I go about bringing a corruption charge against the police?  These things seem very minor I'm sure but as I said I have far more proof's I'm just not sure what I should do with it. (video, pictures, recorded conversations, multiple attempts on my end to contact said department)  Located MN


Thanks for any advice in advanced.  I'm going to work now and will check back on break.  And for clarification I don't have it out for police, all in all I generally get a long with them.  My grandma was a federal officer for 15 years.  I just have no tolerance for anyone who doesn't uphold the law, or rather, feels they ARE the law.",0
"My mother collected life insurance from my fathers death. I was listed as the beneficiary.. My dad died (cancer) back in 2005.  He was divorced from my mother.  My two siblings and I lived with my dad full time.  When he died we went to live with my mother and her new husband.

Shortly after we moved in, they bought a new (not super nice) vehicle.  Then shortly after that a new (not super nice, but bigger) house.  Then another car.  They both worked road construction and made decent money, especially with the lower cost of living, so it didn't seem too strange to 15 year old me.  They just had three kids pushed into their lives, seems like a good reason to make some quality of life upgrades.

Fast forward to 2008/09 when I check the mail one day and see a letter addressed to me from a bank.  I open it to discover that not only do I have an account with them, but that it's overdrawn.  I show my mom the letter, she takes it and says that it's her account and she will handle it.  By this time I'm 17 or 18, so that did send a red flag, but I was still careless enough that I didn't bring it up again.

A couple of months later I get a letter from the IRS saying I owe them close to $15,000.  I don't think I had even earned up to that much in my life at that point.  I ask my mom what this is, she says she will take care of it.

I end up calling the IRS after a couple more letters, they say if I don't agree to a payment plan that they will garnish my wages.  I have no idea what they could be billing me for, so I ask them.  After a few more calls I learn that it's due to a life insurance payout totaling around $68,000.  I started thinking about all the cars and the house and the bank statement and put it together that my mother screwed me out of some life insurance money.  I confront her, she denies it.

Some fucked up shit happens over the next year or so.  My checks are being garnished, her husband  goes to prison, my mom goes through a couple of boyfriends, she tries to kill herself, one of the boyfriends splits with her truck.  And that's just the top of the iceberg.  I have buried so much of those years of my life I can't even begin to unravel it in this post.  Basically the IRS was not a concern, they were just silently taking a chunk of a very small paycheck.  Bills weren't an issue for me, I was living with a friend paying for just the room.

In 2010 I leave Texas for Nebraska, and the IRS follows me.  Things are more expensive here, so having someone else get my money is less acceptable than it was.  I end up getting on the phone with the IRS again and try to explain what I think happened, eventually they tell me that until I take legal action or have my mom take responsibility, they are going to keep taking money.  The last time I talked to my mom was the day I was leaving Texas, she was calling to borrow money.  In between then and now she managed to get sent to prison.

I don't know if the IRS finally figured it out or if my mom did something while she was in prison, but the government mailed me a check for all the wages they had garnished and the lien is marked as paid.  For years I was content with that, but now that I am older and know a little more about the world, I have questions.  This is where I'm hoping to get help from you guys.

How can I have that lien removed from my name?  I feel like it is hurting my credit score.

What are the odds of me seeing any of that money, even though I know it is long well spent (overspent, I'm sure)?

I found a number to the NICB to report insurance fraud, but I wanted to get advice here before I did anything.  

I have a functional relationship with my mom nowadays.  She cleaned up her act and we talk on the phone, I went down to visit once, she says she quit drinking.  I don't want to totally hose her and send her into a downward spiral, but I also want to have a good shot at building my own life without all this IRS red tape in my past.


TL;DR: I think my mom fraudulently took insurance money from me, left me with the taxes, which led to me being garnished and having a lien filed.  I would like to at least have the lien removed, any of the money that can be recovered without putting my mom in a hardship would also be welcome.",0
"[ME] Can I stop my mom from collecting child support intended for me?. I'm sorry for how long this is but I don't know how to make this situation any simpler. 

Some background: I'm 19, my brother is 17, and my parents got divorced ~15 years ago. The divorce was messy, drawn-out and complicated by my mother's mental health problems, and the fact that she wanted full custody and our dad out of our lives completely.

Though the court awarded 50/50 shared custody, my dad was ordered to pay child support because he'd been supporting our family by running his own business while my mom stayed home. A year or two after the divorce my mom (still unemployed) moved to a town hours away in an attempt to force the custody issue, and took my dad back to court seeking full custody again. She lost and after that point only saw my brother and I for three weekends a month and every other week in the summer, though she retained 50/50 ""rights and responsibilities"" and so continued collecting child support from my dad. In the intervening years my dad has had to close his business and file for bankruptcy (thanks to legal debt), go on food stamps and pick up multiple extra jobs just to keep our family afloat. My mom was well-employed for several years, but has also gone through several long periods of unemployment where child support was her only income. All my health expenses, school supplies, extracurriculars, clothes, food, etc. was paid for by my dad; my mom bought me food when I was with her and that was about it. Any kind of support from her stopped when I was sixteen, when I moved out and cut contact with her due to a violent incident.

Throughout all these changes the amount of child support paid has never been reviewed or modified from the original amount (I don't know the exact figure but it's hundreds of dollars a month). I've talked to my dad about it on and off for years, and he is terrified of going back to court and the effect it will have on our family. The last time my parents were in court my mom falsely accused my dad of abusing her, sexually abusing me, stalking, etc. He also can't afford another costly court battle and believes my mom can- though she's since become estranged from her entire family who backed her financially last time they went to court, she's currently dating a fairly wealthy guy who spends a lot of money on her. 

This is all complicated by the fact that two years ago when our financial situation was extremely bad my dad stopped paying my mom child support. I'm really angry with him for doing this because I know it's illegal and could look bad in future legal proceedings, but my dad suffers from his own issues and I know he didn't see any other options at the time. My mom eventually reported it to the state and now they are garnishing his paycheck. The amount he owes continues to grow, in part because the state is still collecting child support for me even though I'm 19.

I want to get my dad off the hook for child support, at least for me (my brother still visits my mom a few times a month, although she cancelled last-minute on spending christmas and a couple weekends with him this year). I'm sure there's little chance of getting the child support adjusted for the years she didn't support me at all, or adjusted for my parents' changed financial situations without having all their tax paperwork, but is there any way I can inform the state that I'm not a minor anymore and to stop collecting child support in my name? Alternatively, what are some good legal arguments to convince my dad to try to modify the child support himself? I have no idea how long he's planning on letting this go on, and our family could really use any extra money (I'm putting myself through college because the bankruptcy/debt means my dad's ineligible for loans, but he's still helping out with groceries so I don't starve, and with my brother going to college soon we don't know how we're going to manage). It's ridiculous, at this point it feels like we're just throwing cash into a bottomless pit. 

***tl;dr:*** My mom is collecting child support she doesn't need or deserve. Do I, the 19 yr old child, have any grounds to put a stop to it? If not, what can I do to convince my dad to take action?",0
"Evicting Tenant in VA: Do I understand this correctly? Other Questions.... I've tried to supply all the infomation that I can (so it's long) - questions at the bottom. Thanks!

Obviously, talking with a VA lawyer is on the table, but I'd also like to wrap my head around things. 

Backstory:
- Current GF bought a house back in 2004, VA
- Lived there for years with her sister. 
- Decided to go to Med School, Sister got married and moved
- Rented the House out to a friend of a friend
- No property management
- Everything was fine, until recently
- We are all going to sit down and talk about a plan of action this weekend. I've been reading VA laws to try and get a handle on options. 


Downside(s):
- GF is in residency in OH (3rd year) and hasn't had time to visit VA for a little over a year. Being in VA will be next to impossible until July 2018, but could be around xmas if they give residents time off. There may be options to trade days with other residents and get a weekend off
- Lease is up in January; very simple cookie cutter lease (just pretend a lease doesn't exist outside of ending in Jan)
- No security deposit made, no last month's rent


Recent Events (last year or so)
- Tenant has been systematically later and later on rent and will pay portions. 
- In June, Tenant was behind a month and send 3 checks. June and July's rent were post-dated until the 10th of the month (when rent is due on the 1st). 3rd check was a partial payment for the behind amount (about 80%)
- My GF has always been lenient, so there are no late fees in the lease and no warnings outside of text messages
- GF's sister was driving through VA to visit in Ohio and stopped to do a walk through of the property
- Apparently, the place is a wreck. Garbage everywhere, doors off of hinges (or broken), un-kept yard, smoke detectors hanging from the ceiling, mold from soap scum growing in the bathtub, etc. 
- A strong odor of weed in the basement - tenant admitted to her co-tenant smoking weed inside


According to the sister, the place is absolutely trashed and will require a couple of thousand dollars to make the necessary repairs. She apparently took pictures, but I haven't seen them yet. Sister believes tenant should be evicted, repairs made, and a new tenant found. Brother in law claims to have had property in VA and mentioned it taking a very long time (8 months or so) for the eviction to happen. He was awarded a large sum to cover damages, but never actually got any of the money. I'd like to avoid that here. 



Eviction:
- LL must provide a notice, depending on 1) not paying rent (giving 5 days to fix) or 2) Violating the lease (30 days notice, but 21 days to correct the issue) or 3) Criminal Activity (no notice needed, straight to filing a complaint with the court)
- If tenant doesn't fix the problem in the time frame, we file a complaint with the appropriate court in VA
- Have a hearing where the judge hears both sides and decides (or potentially pushes back to another date for a fuller trial)?
- Tenant can supply a defense


**Questions**
- Since my GF is super busy, can I represent her in court or for any of the proceedings? 
- There are some obligations that the LL has to maintain the property, but it looks like VA law requires the tenant to provide notice. 21 days for the LL to fix or the Tenant can break the lease. Since the Tenant hasn't mentioned any necessary repairs (not in writing, text, or voice), can she still use this as a defense? 
- If there is no real lease, is essentially trashing the place enough to count as violating the lease?
- Does the LL have a good chance at winning small claims for any damages caused by the the tenant? 
- If we follow the rules, how long should we expect an eviction to take place? (Let's say tenant gets a notice to fix or quit on the 15th and does nothing. We could file a complaint in court on 8/15? If we're blessed enough to get a trial soon after (9/1) and the judge rules in favor of the LL - when would the tenant have to be out? Another 30 days? 

Is there anything else I should consider?

We're mainly trying to avoid periods of time when my GF has to pay both her current rent AND the mortgage on the house. Any time that the house is unusable and no one is paying rent, it's going to be a huge strain.",1
"(MA) Management confiscated and opened a threatening box. They were wrong but are now restricting all my packages.. I don't think this is reasonable, but I'm not sure what I can do to counter it! This is in Boston, MA.


A few weeks ago I ordered a shirt in support of a charity involving veterinary care for neglected and abandoned animals. My workplace was having a special event where everyone would wear things like that and others would donate. I know it doesn't sound relevant, but surprisingly it is. Unlike other ""brands"" that have promotional products made by outsourced companies like teefury, the founder of this charity is involved in the firearm industry and apparently got a company that usually sells things related to that to make the shirts instead. Not a big deal, if anything the shirt itself is much nicer quality! 


Unfortunately they shipped the shirt to me in a box with the firearm company's name/logo on it. 


Unbeknownst to me my apartment complex has a set of rules (that I was never told, I rent from a different management company) that restricts the possession of firearms of any sort. Again, this was never mentioned to me in my lease or any paperwork regarding the building. It never really mattered since I don't own any weapons but it'd be nice to know.


Packages are dropped off beyond the first set of locked doors but still within a common area. It's just a big pile and you dig through and take what has your name on it. I work long hours so I got the delivery notice after I got to work and was excited to pick it up when I got home that evening. Much to my dismay my box wasn't there when I finally arrived. I figured it might have gotten stolen since that was an issue in the past. When I went upstairs to my apartment I found a note slipped under my door explaining that a ""concerned tenant"" recognized the company name and reported my box to the building's management. They came and confiscated the box before I got home. I called my own property manager and she admitted that she forgot to call me but the box was dropped at their office by the building manager that afternoon. 


I headed over to the office and picked up my box which was, surprise, opened. I was a little shocked by that since I was under the impression that it's a felony to open someone else's mail. My property manager said that she didn't open it, the building manager did in an attempt to ""catch"" me buying firearm accessories. Naturally they found a charity tshirt instead.


I was (and am) still annoyed but it was just the shirt and it was totally undamaged. However I ordered some tea from amazon earlier this week and had the same problem again. They ""held"" my package when it arrived since I'm now a person of interest. This time they didn't open it and just passed the box along to my management company and insisted that it be opened with witnesses to prove that it isn't gun related. It's tea. Sleepytime tea, probably the least threatening thing possible. 


I don't understand why they're doing this, I've been in this apartment for two years with absolutely no issues. Why they think I'm ordering firearms online is beyond me. This whole ""monitoring"" of my orders seems like it'll be a huge pain, my management company is too far to walk so each time I have to go to them I have to take an uber. Those costs add up! 


Do I have any right to demand they leave my mail alone? From what I can tell they don't look in my locked mail slot since a tiny package that was put in there the same day wasn't taken while the tea was. It also sounds like it's the building management, not my specific apartment's management that's doing this. I talked to my manager and she said she can't do anything since they give the packages to the secretary. If I do have a case to get them to back off, are there any actual laws I can cite? Do the bylaws of the building trump the city/state laws? They aren't taking my packages intending to keep them, they just seem to want me to open everything in front of someone else. Does it still count as witholding mail if they aren't asking for anything in return? I don't know how this would deter me from just buying things in person though, it doesn't make much sense it they intend to prevent purchases. 


Any help would be fantastic!",1
"[Oregon] Facing loosing Medicaid right when I have to leave work due to mental illness and unsafe work environment. Help?. (suicide tw throughout this post) Background: I have struggled with depression/bipolar for a number of years, and just over a year ago it caused me to be unemployed for 3 months as I was doing outpatient and recovering.  Found a new job that I love in many ways and really care about, but it didn't stop the number of suicide attempts.  I had to take multiple leaves of absences and numerous sick days for my mental well-being.

At the same time I have struggled with mismanagement at my job.  One situation was due to higher ups not respecting my confidentiality and they dragged me through the mud, forcing me to get union involvement.  Coworkers have also been getting away with a lot of things to the detriment of my health.  I've been yelled at, I've been subjected to repeated oppressive statements, I've dealt with a coworker assuming more authority than they're given and giving everyone and attitude.  They also sexually harassed another coworker.  One person is plainly abusive and toxic, another dangerously incompetent. Despite my efforts to bring this to HR and to my bosses nothing has happened.  The main person in question triggered one suicide attempt.  I had gone to HR a couple months ago and when they once again yelled at me in front of everyone and gave me attitude I once again brought it to management.  I was told nothing was going to happen.

I ended up asking management to at least have remediation.  They got weird about it because I ended up calling out sick because a number of factors, including work, had triggered a mixed state episode.  The exchange wasn't great but the most I really said was ""I'll talk to you when I get back"" and unprofessionally disclosing over text that the person was continuing to sexually harass the other coworker.  I almost died that night due to suicide. 7th time since early 2016.  I felt so hopeless and that nothing would improve. Because of this incident I ended up having to move further away to be taken care of by friends.  This interferes with my schedule on Sundays because the bus nearby doesn't run and I can't get there until an hour later than my schedule. 

Long story short, manager flipped his attitude 180 after talking to his boss (who doesn't like me) and won't budge on my schedule and was *rude* about it.  They have made these accommodations before for people and I very much believe that I'm facing my employer trying to edge me out because I don't keep quiet about BS that happens there. 

This BS severely impacts me because I do care about this job and I can't handle the lack of care or the things they put everyone through.  Amazingly the news about my schedule didn't induce suicidal thinking again because I actually was already planning to kill myself but then got righteously angry about this situation and looked forward to quitting. 

But anyways here's the problem:  I go back to work on Tuesday, I am losing my medicaid health insurance at the end of the month, and I only have this week to apply for employer provided health insurance. I have to wait until Monday to contact Union person and I have an HR person on my back asking to schedule a time to sign up for the insurance.  I also cannot have a lapse in insurance or I might die (no exaggeration).  If I quit as soon as possible I can probably keep it without coverage lapsing. It seems off to sign up for this insurance if I'm about to quit, but if I want to go on disability (which would take years apparently) I need my doctor or nurse practitioner to state that I am unable to work, which will take time.  I also am unsure if me saying ""I'm too sick to work"" contradicts ""The way you run this place is inhospitable for me"".  The latter implies that I can work elsewhere when I really can't, but the former makes it sound like it's my own problem that I'm too sensitive to work there. 

What steps outside of contacting Union person asap is there? Do I put in my two weeks asap? Can I get unemployment if I quit before a doctor orders me to stop work? Do I apply for that insurance?  Can I delay ending my OHP with minimal trouble (I don't have the capacity to fight so many things at once). Do I bow out peacefully or do I point my finger at them?",0
"Canada [ON-AB] - Permanent type 2 diabetes caused by steroids prescribed from doctor. I am sorry in advance if this is long

3.5 years ago I had some issues where I woke up and wasn't able to move my joints, this was accompanied by large lumps on my legs. I was 24 years old (Female). I was referred to a dermatologist as they thought I had Erythema nodosum. Over a month or so I was doing tons of blood work and seeing this dermatologist anywhere from 1-3 times a week. I was constantly being told it was something else and being put on new medication. During this month I was also referred to a rheumatologist. Rheumatology and dermatology had a big meeting (?) where there were roughly 50 specialists of different levels in a room (I dont know what its called) to discuss my case because it was extremely rare. I was diagnosed with something called ""polyarteritis nodosa"" which is a rare form of vasculitis. My dermatologist called me with great news that they finally new what it was and then prescribed me.. prednisone (a oral steroid). I was given it for 6 weeks. Over this 6 weeks I started experiencing dehydration, frequent urination, some weightloss, extreme fatigue. I made appointments and saw him on numerous occasions because I felt that this should not be happening and something felt very wrong. He assured me it was just side effects and would send me on my way. At the end of the 6 weeks he essentially told me I was good to go and that I shouldn't have any more flare ups. Roughly a week later I started seeing lumps on my legs again and quickly made an appointment. Without questions, blood work, anything, he prescribed me another 6 weeks of prednisone. He told me he absolutely did not want to see me for 6 weeks and to not come back in. I started taking it and within a day or two all the side effects came back.. and they only got worse. I started losing lumps of hair, losing drastic weight and started blacking out. I would leave class ( I was a student at the time) and then wake up on a couch in the hall 4 hours later. I had lost roughly 35 lbs which was essentially all muscle. I am overweight and always have been.. my legs were the size that someones upper arm should be. I started barely being able to walk because my body wanted to collapse. After 3 weeks I made an appointment. The first thing the doctor said to me was ""I said I didn't want to see you for 6 weeks"".  I started crying and told him something was very wrong. Then he said ""I think you have type 2 diabetes because you are so overweight"".  This came from a doctor that ran 15+ blood tests on me months prior. He sent me for blood work that day and I got a call from the emergency room.  My sugar levels were at 29 mmol/L (540mg/dl). I was kept in the hospital that night and had an IV of fluids going through me. The nurse I had was talking to me and was very confused as to why the doctor put me on prednisone. She went and spent some time reviewing my file. She came back and told me that before the steroids my blood sugar levels were completely normal. She told me that in that meeting with all the doctors.. every single doctor recommended he NOT put me on prednisone because of the risk of type 2 diabetes (Due to the fact that im over weight). I am in the process of retrieving all my files from the hospital. I recently moved out of Ontario to Alberta. My diabetes are pretty controlled but this is still something that will effect me for my entire life. I know it has been 3.5 years but at the time I had no energy to think of anything to do with legal, I was also a student. Now that I am in my career and still need to see numerous doctors on a regular basis I am starting to realize how much what he did has effected my life and will continue to do so. I pay for medications that I should have never needed if it wasn't for him. Although being overweight I am and extremely active, healthy person. I always have been. I played soccer for 18 years, basketball for 5. I was a bike messenger riding 60-70km daily before moving to alberta.. this should have never happened. I need to know if it is worth it to go and talk to a lawyer. 

Tl;DR  - a doctor gave me a medication against the advice of roughly 50 other doctors that resulted in me developing type 2 diabetes despite me showing all signs of type 2 and him ignoring. Do I go to a lawyer?",0
"[CA] Custody question with an unknown but biological father. Hi everyone, posting this to get some info about a situation in California.  Thank you in advance for your advice and help!  
  
This is a question about custody over a kid.  I read some links (pasted at the end of my post) in an attempt to answer my question, but I'm hoping to get more info and perspectives here.  
  
Will try and keep things simple in bullet form.  Here is some background:  
  
* Anna and Bob have a daughter Sally (Sally is now 8 years old)  
  
* Anna and Bob were never married, they simply lived together.  Bob is legally not the dad, but is the biological father (Sally has no legal father)   
  
* When Sally was still an infant, Anna left Bob due to emotional abuse (not physical as far as I know) and general unhappiness, and has been raising Sally as a single mom for the last 6+ years (while living with Anna's parents)  
  
* Anna and Bob are on civil, if not amicable, terms.  Bob usually takes Sally out for a day/afternoon once a week.  Sometimes Sally will stay with dad a few days at a time, when mom has to travel  
  
* Anna is single, Bob is now dating and living with a woman Candy who has kids from an prior marriage and when he takes Sally, it is almost always with Candy or to her/their home
  
* Bob has never paid any kind of child support, whether documented or undocumented.  Bob (currently) has no legal rights or access to Sally, everything is worked out between Anna and Bob on a personal level.  Anna wants Sally to have a dad, so she wants to keep Bob in Sally's life, even though she does not care for Bob at all  
  
Now for recent events:  
  
* Bob's girlfriend Candy recently met Anna, and started interacting with (borderline harassing) Anna (over text and call), and long story short, as a result of those conversations, Anna fears that Candy may be a bad influence on Sally, or may even be trying to poison Sally against her.  
  
* Anna asked Bob to see Sally alone, or at least not let Sally see / interact with Candy.  Need to emphasize that Anna is not doing this to spite or make life difficult for Bob (and certainly not to get child support).  It is out of genuine concern.  
  
* Bob agreed to do so verbally and over text, but Anna has since discovered that Bob is still taking Sally to Candy's or going out with Candy together, just as before  
  
Questions:  
  
* Does Anna have a (legal) right to request Bob not have Sally see Candy?  Would this be a tenable and legal request?  
  
* What are some ways this could play out from a legal perspective if a custody battle ensues?  
  
To elaborate more on why Anna does not want Candy interacting with Sally--there is no apparent threat or evidence of physical harm / danger.  It's simply that Candy is a drama-filled, selfish, and manipulative person so Anna would rather not have her daughter influenced by Candy.  To be honest, there is probably little tangible evidence that ""proves"" Candy would be a bad influence (not even sure how that works legally), but that's just how Anna feels as a mom.  Bob is not necessarily a deceitful or bad person, but is extremely simple-minded, and likely being controlled by Candy, so Anna cannot rely on Bob to shield Sally from potentially bad influence, or even to keep his word about when and how he sees Sally.  
  
I read the info in these two links in an attempt to answer my question  
  
* https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-child-custody-and-visitation-2997637  
  
* http://www.livestrong.com/article/140913-what-rights-do-fathers-have-if-they-are-not-birth-record/   
  
Based on that, I think Bob will have to establish paternity, at which point he can enter a custody battle with Anna.  What are some ways a judge may rule in this case, with all of the factors above?  Any chance for supervised visitation only, or unsupervised, but specifically no contact with Candy?  I am aware that Anna may appear as a jealous mom in court with such a request, but that is not the case.  She was initially happy that Sally could have some semblance of a ""family life,"" but has since discovered that Candy would not be a good ""second mom,"" so I'm just trying to get a read on the situation from the experts here.
  
Thank you for reading!  Again, any additional help or advice would be greatly appreciated!  Please let me know if more info is needed.",0
"Questions about Missouri Probation, And violations for Failure to Pay Restitution. - LONG but Urgent.. Hello /r/legaladvice 

This may be a bit long, but this is very important to me and I can't really afford an attorney and time is of the essence.


When I was 18 I was sentenced to a 5 year term of probation, with 4 years DOC on an SIS back in 2007 for Felony Theft (Class C) and Attempting to Steal by Deceit (Class D), I was ordered to pay restitution and court costs in both cases totaling almost $5k. 

Fast forward to 2011 and I had moved from Missouri to Wyoming as I had been struggling to find any work at all in Missouri, I had hoped it would get better right? 2 Felonies and a shitty economy made things rough, Anyhow, I managed to find temp work, nothing steady and come June 2011 a Probation Violation was filed and a warrant issued out of Missouri for Failure to Pay restitution and court costs, I was arrested and spent 30 days in county jail in Wyoming before being extradited (Another $600 in costs added to total) back to Missouri for a hearing. 

The court revoked my SIS, Sentenced me to an additional 5 years probation on a SES and told me I could NOT go back to Wyoming, So I had essentially been uprooted, lost all of my belongings and was homeless from the start of my new probation term.

-----

Still unable to find jobs, I decided to try my hand at getting my CDL and truck driving, well the trucking industry turns out is not very felony friendly either!  I managed to lock down a shitty job making just above minimum wage and struggled to pay my bills let alone any court costs, I managed to pay about $500 total over 2 years.

2014 Rolls around and I guess I had been earning a ""Earned Compliance Credit"" for being good with 0 violations of my probation and my Probation was set to end early due to that, And here came another Probation Violation, For failure to pay Restitution and Fines, Court revoked my ECC and ordered me to an additional year of probation making it end on July 11th, 2017.

Fast forward a few years, I finally landed a decent job last year, Finally was able to save up some money, paid over half of my Restitution and Court costs, Now I have a probation violation AGAIN for Failure to pay, and they have issued a Warrant for my Arrest, This has all happened in the last 8 days, My Probation was set to expire 7/11/2017 (TODAY) but I have A warrant and a Violation filed against me so that won't happen.

-----

So here I sit, zero legal knowledge, and using google,

I managed to find multiple cases in Missouri from the Supreme court which are quite similar to mine, Defendants Probations revoked due to being indigent, and then over ruled by the supreme court as it violated the 14th Amendment to Equal Protection.

One part of particular interest to me is in one of the cases, The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that Earned Compliance Credits could not be suspended or revoked merely because a person was indigent and unable to pay, while those who were affulent would still be able to earn them because they don't face the same hardships. [Found on Page 15](https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=99059)

But yet during a period of numerous hardships, The judge revoked my ECC and ordered me additional terms of probation?

[Also to the fact, Missouri's very own statute on Probation terms says that Felony probation can not exceed a TOTAL of 6 years including a 1 year extension](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=559.016&amp;bid=29097&amp;hl=) But yet I have been on probation for 10 years now?

[Missouri is trying to amend its Earned Compliance Credits to include a new area saying that Probationers can not be released if they still owe restitution](http://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills171/hlrbillspdf/1343H.01I.pdf)

[However that has not been passed, and is not in effect yet](https://legiscan.com/MO/bill/HB595/2017).

What are my Options right now? Have I been seriously screwed over by the judicial system by them not only extending my probation an additional 5 years on top of the first 5, but by the Judge suspending my ECC under false grounds? If my ECC would not have been suspended I would have been released from probation in 2014... Making my current situation irrelevant.

I honestly feel cheated by the system for being indigent most of my life, and I really need some guidance!

Thanks a ton,

"(Canada) Question regarding Domestic case with my man and how to undo these things in the best way for both of us.. Not too long ago, my bf and I had gotten into an argument in regards to something, it had escalated a bit but not never to the point of me being fearful for myself. 
We squabbled, I drove away with his things and he had jumped back from the car door and ended up putting a ding on the backside of my car. 

We ended up eventually resolving our issues but not before exchanging a few words in our home which we share together. 

We had spent a great 5 days after the fact, being happy, issue being resolved, celebrating our anniversary, and doing everything together as we always do.

About 5 days after the fact, we ended up having another one where I had told him it was over between us, which isn't what I wanted, but I was forced to because work had temporarily gotten involved with our last one and told me to make a choice. 

He ended up getting angry and leaving, but not before exchanging words and hitting the dry wall, causing damage as he left.

I ended up calling the police, thinking that it would blow over, and he would be told to cool it and not be so stupid.

Unfortunately that wasn't the case, as many years ago he had a very bad domestic case, in which he ended up doing some weekend time and house arrest. Mind you, this was a terrible part of his life where he had issues with drugs and alcohol, he had made threats, and used a knife to destroy vehicle property, while he was intoxicated. So this was nothing like it, as he has never shown violence against me nor have I ever been fearful of him or for my safety. 

We've built a life together, and although he has some temperament issues, he works hard, always making sure my needs come above his, that our dogs are happy and safe. Never letting the lack of money affect us, as he makes sure there's food in the house and bills are paid if I'm struggling with money at work. 

He's my best friend, and I his, and we've always been able to tackle anything given that we did it together, we've been unstoppable, for lack of a better word. 

But back on track, I ended up getting interviewed and asked questions by an investigator in regards to the fight, they had asked me the same questions 10 different ways, they weren't very nice about it either, and had made me sign something that I wouldn't recant, and if I did, I would be charged. 

So now, because of this, and all these questions about our past fights regarding this matter, and exchanges of words, he's being charged with mischief x2, uttering threats to cause death, and assault. 

I never wanted any of this, and had even told the investigator that. He had told me it's too late and they had everything they needed. 
I had told them that I'm not fearful, and that he wouldn't do anything to ever hurt me, because he wouldn't.

I even mentioned that he can come see our dogs whenever he wants and not have any restrictions, as he is truly a great man that just struggles with some issues at times, and he deserves to see his boys. 
But most importantly, I never wanted to get him in trouble, I love him, and want us to fix our problems, because he is the love of my life, no matter the circumstance. 

Unfortunately, as of now, he isn't allowed to contact me directly or indirectly, or see our boys without having his surety present. 
My question is, what can I do to make this easier on us? 
He had admitted to the mischief, but the alleged threats and assault, he refused to comment on.
Mind you, he has never laid his hand on me. But in an argument, even a shoulder bump, or a chest bump can be treated as an assault. 

I was told by an officer that I can call the crown and ask to have the restrictions changed, but will they do it? Will they just try to use it against him?
Can I recant my statement without being punished?
How do I fix this before it breaks our family?
Is there anything I can do?

Lastly I ask that you please do not post judgemental responses, or tell me that I'm a victim, it takes two to tango so to speak, and there are two sides to every story. 
He's an incredible man and I love and cherish him dearly, I'm also a strong and independent woman who's capable of handling herself, I'm hardly PC, and don't much care for sympathy in the way of, ""Get away from him, you're a victim and deserve to be treated like a queen"" etc. 

Thank you.",0
"Property Equity dispute...continued.... NEW YORK....

It would be best to read by previous post before reading this as this is a follow up....I apologize for any repeated info. it's a frustrating experience. 

Hello reddit

So this continues and I am seeking more feedback. My Uncle doesn't seem to recognize or take into consideration that my mother has paid all the bills, and taxes and has worked hard to maintain the home. Years have passed with zero financial or sweat equity investment on his part yet he doesn't reason with the fact these things should effect his equity. It isn't a legal thing in my mind but a moral obligation. The home has greatly increased in value over the years.

His argument is that none of the work done to the house after the initial construction was authorized by him nor was he consulted with and he could have insisted the house be sold or he bought out years ago. This IMO further strengthens the fact that he should not be entitled to half the equity. He owns half a house in which he hasn't contributed half to and he all but admits he didn't and would not have contributed to all the things that has greatly increased the value of the home through those years. Additionally, the loan (100k) taken out to do all the construction and improvements to the house is paid for by my mother. It's half her equity but technical should not be. Yet, again he expects to reap the rewards......

The house has an apartment and part of his argument is he feels he should have been given half the rental income all along and he wasn't. This still doesn't make sense since again, he hasn't invested in it or paid any of the taxes. Plus the rental income helped pay for all those things. He feels he has legal ground on all of this. Additionally, my mom had stated in the past, partly due to all his pressure on the house, that she wanted him to have her half if he would out live her. Not myself and my brothers. She didn't want us to squabble about the house. Though it certainly didn't mean he exclude us one any liquidation. However, this wasn't meant to be solely about the equity. It was meant in part that he gets the physical house to do what he wants. Live in it, rent it, whatever. He feels this was solely about the equity. Unfortunate for him my mom needed to use her equity for the construction, improvements and to live on for a short time while she was out of work. To this, he is mad, upset, outraged even that he isn't getting her equity ""because it is what she promised'. He doesn't get that the house carries debt, that she needed to use her equity, that the money she spent increased the value. She took a second loan with out his knowledge but it didn't touch his equity. She lives in and cares for the house. The whole thing is an inheritance in the first place and IMO anything above and beyond his share would have been a gift, free money and he has no right to be mad that he isn't getting a debt free house.

I just don't understand any of this. It is as if he was all along waiting, expecting, and fully anticipated getting every dollar from the house for nothing and that he didn't have any obligations. It was all being care for and paid for, for him and he expected a windfall.

Additionally, when my mom moved into the house my grandmother was still living. She cared for her (their mother) while she was sick and paid all the bills until she passed. He wasn't anywhere around. I just would not feel as he does about any of this. I'd consider all of it and be understanding of it. Especially, if the other person cared for my mom, the property and paid for it all through the years. I wouldn't complain and except any amount given to me with in reason. Your going to argue with a six figure check for doing nothing?

Can anyone add to this ? Isn't it reasonable to think considering all the facts that the valuation of his equity should be his equity minus some taxes paid over the years, some of the maintenance cost including some sweat equity. It's really what is fair. It isn't a case of trying to take away his equity or treat him unfairly. It is something my mom has always stated. His real equity should be half the equity of the house minus taxes and carry over costs so nothing is being taken from him. If a buy out happens today while she is still alive that is what it should be. Their are bills to be paid even when she passes and some of the costs over the years should be recouped.

Thank you all.",1
"Washington State VA Abuse Question. Good Morning,

I'm writing this as a request to find out what I should do with regards to patient abuse. The patient in question is my father, and below I've copied the draft that my mother, a RN nurse of 20+ years, wrote.

Essentially my father's back was messing up and we had to go to the ER at the VA due to urinary incontinence and met Dr. A.

Dr. A was condescending, told them they should not be there because the ER is for people with real problems, (cancer, amputations, etc), and asked if my father had any bowel problems. Dr.A was told no, and then insisted on doing 2 anal exams. He never washed his hands, did not physically help my father orient himself, barked orders at him while my father was struggling to move, and threatened to send him home because sphincter tone was normal. 

My mother questioned Dr.A about the urinary incontinence because our primary care physician told us to come in specifically when that occurs. Dr.A ordered a bladder scan, saw the urinary incontinence times 2, then transferred us to the Harborview ER (Seattle). 

Below is the draft letter that my mother wrote to file a complaint, and i was hoping I could get some feedback/help with ensuring that it is received with the amount of urgency that it deserves.

Looking for criticisims/edits/review, as well as legal advice for proceeding forward. 

We are located in Seattle, Wa.


***Draft Letter***

	July 12’ 2017
Attn:  Medical Center Director
	I am sending this complaint in regards to an ER visit for my husband, Patient, on June 18’ 2017. 
	My husband was being treated at the American Lake VA since late May’ 2017 for a back injury.  He’d been to PT with a referral in for Neurology and Sports Medicine d/t quickly progressive symptoms.   During the course of 1 week he went from walking independently to being given a cane and then a rolling walker by PT.  We were instructed at the last MD appointment to go to ER if any difficulty with urination occurred or if pain became intolerable.  
	On Sunday, June 18’2017, we ended up in the Seattle VA ER d/t 2 episodes of incontinence/retention over the past 3 days and intolerable pain.  I arrived with my husband assisting him to ambulate with the rolling walker d/t him being barely able to stand.  
	Dr. A was our ER doctor.  His attitude from the moment he stepped into our room was condescending and dismissive.  He showed nothing but disregard for my husband’s condition stating that people usually come into the ER for real problems such as Cancer or Amputations.  My husband had severe progressive numbness, tingling and pain down his right leg, all of which occurred over the course of 1 week.  He asked my husband if he had any bowel incontinence and was told no.  He then decided to perform a sphincter exam x2 with obvious force with both penetrating entries and no handwashing at any time.  Afterwards he did not wipe the gel off either time but left him there on his side struggling to move in severe pain.   Of note, this is for a man who can’t lie straight d/t back pain and can barely move without assistance.  This was all after bowel incontinence had already been denied.  Dr. A was ready to send my husband home until I questioned him about the episodes of urinary incontinence.  He then decided a bladder US would be in order, which should have been done as opposed to a rectal exam for the initial complaint.    After the US showed urinary retention after multiple attempts he transferred us to the Harborview ER.  On the transfer form he noted my husband to be ambulatory as if he was independent, no note of 1 person assist or ambulatory aide needed.    The end result being my husband was admitted and MRI showed a moderate L5-S1 disc herniation with nerve impingement.  He’s since had a microdiscectomy performed and is now healing.  
	I understand many people have back pain, but for Dr. A to be so dismissive of a person is poor practice and abuse of his own perceived power.  He is a bully to the point he is on the line of patient abuse.    I don’t believe this man is fit to work with patients, especially a vulnerable population such as veterans.  My biggest concern are for the patients in the VA system who have no one to speak for them.  Most veterans are not knowledgeable of how patients should be treated.  The treatment and testing from Dr. A for my husband was wrong and abusive.

"2008 Sexual Misconduct of a Minor over Internet and Phone- I was 14 in Ohio and he was 21 in South Carolina. Hello. I would just like some information about something that happened to me and my friends when we were young teenagers. I tried to use google to get information but it was confusing and not specific towards my situation. I'm using a throwaway since I don't want this attached to my main profile. I think this is the correct sub for my questions.
Our interactions were during 2008. We lived in Ohio and John lived in South Carolina. 

He met my friend Julie over Xbox online chat. John was friends with Julie's older brother and she was using her brothers account.
He said he was 21 and she said she was 15 (she was really 13) he talked to her and they developed a romantic relationship. Flirting and talking to each other and all that. Julie introduced us to him so we could get to know him. Sarah was 14 with over protective parents, and she felt uneasy and unsure about him. I was 14 and wanted to get to know him and make sure he was ok.
As I got to know him I would ask him questions and advice about growing up and boys and sex.

I still have some copies of some of our chats over gmail but most of our messaging was over aim. I accidentally revealed Julie was actually 13. He was upset about it and didn't want to talk to her anymore, but eventually got over it and continued to talk to us.
Over time our messaging got more dirty and we would talk on the phone as well. I know he was romantically dating my friend and I'm a shitty person for getting flirty and intimate with him.
Eventually he taught me how to have phone sex. At the end of one of the early sessions he said if I told anyone he'd kill me. I freaked out a little but he said he was only joking. We had phone sex regularly. I still have some of the chats on my gmail were I was talking about me moaning and him liking it. We even talked about that when he could finally come up to see Julie about the possibility of him and I having sex.

He stopped having phone sex abruptly with me. He said he was feeling guilty about having phone sex with me while being in a relationship with Julie. I've always wondered if he started having phone sex with her and was just done with me, but I never asked her about it. I've never told Julie about any of this. We've lost touch but we're still friends on Facebook, I figured I might ask her about it since we're not close friends anymore so I wouldn't have to worry about loosing anything with her lol.

Eventually our families found out we were talking to strangers on the internet. The three of us got in a lot of trouble over it. I told my family I was talking to him to make sure he was a nice guy and wasn't going to hurt Julie. I never mentioned the sexual conversations or the phone sex to them and denied that anything like that ever happened. The guy we were talking to ended up blocking us.

I don't know if I have any options right now. I'm not too affected by it, just kind of disturbed and disgusted. I know this definitely probably helped to promote my promiscuity as a teenager, but other stuff happened when I was as an even younger child so that probably helped to encourage my promiscuity too, but that's a different fucked up story lol.

Mostly I'm concerned if he did anything to Julie but I can just talk to her about it. My biggest concern is if he would do something like this again to someone else.

I have a handful of chats from my gmail account, I never delete anything. I've also had the same cell phone number since I was 13 so maybe phone records can be reviewed.

I don't really think I can press charges. I'm just worried about him doing it again to someone else.

I know Julie's older brother was talking to Johns younger sister for a while as well, even after our families found out about John. I know he was in a really terrible car accident a couple of years before he talked to us, and he showed us an article about it and it had the name he gave us, so I'm pretty sure he never lied about his name. I know he was becoming a Christian and I think he was involved or going to a Christian school. I think he said he was going to write a book about his accident and his relationship with god.
Do you think I should report what happened? Who would I report it to? Would they even be able to find evidence against him or find him? I know I have 2 chats from 2008 about us talking and planning on having phone sex.

What do you guys think?",0
"[AZ] [TN] - Can a tenant decide rent is considered paid based on personal circumstances?. Long complicated story warning.  Bonus if you like this sort of thing I guess.
  
So Son &amp; DIL move into my AZ house (house is in my name only, my wife is not on the deed) when I move to TN.  They make significant changes to the house such as totally remodeling the kitchen and also replacing major appliances without prior notice.  At first I panic because WTF.  But they are family and so I let it ride after talking about it with my son and making it perfectly clear that they are not now, and never shall be, the homeowner.  I also ask them not to make any more changes without prior consent.  As it turns out the kitchen job was a nice improvement.  But the washer and drier were replaced when I was never told they may or may not have had issues (they were fine when we moved out).  Stove also replaced, but I caught wind of that one and told them to put mine in the garage instead of throwing it away.  Not sure if it is still there.  Again it was fine when we left the state.
  
Fast forward a couple years and they are getting divorced.  At one point, the police arrive and **BOTH** of them end up in lockup for a night due to domestic violence.  No kids.
  
So she moves out at the end of June leaving most of her belongings.  We are here in TN trying to not take sides but also not go insane.  He puts her items on the back patio (which is covered) for her movers/friends to take.  For ""reasons"" she has not taken them all yet but continues to claim that the movers are coming to get the rest ""soon"".  He does not want to have her and three or four friends walking through the house taking things and I don't blame him.  He agrees to her and one other person for a walk through.
  
Rent has not been paid for June or July.  She wants a reference letter from me stating that she lived there from Date_1 to Date_2 and the final month's rent paid was $XXXX.  I was going to just sign it and give it to her in the interest of family ties and ask her politely for half the June rent.
  
Before I could make this communication, she sends a letter via FB to my wife located [here at PasteBin](https://pastebin.com/yXj3j75R) (all identifying information has been scrubbed).  In it she claims that there were repairs required to make the place livable.  This is inherently untrue.  There are some repairs to the guest bathroom sink area that could be made and I said I would in order to help them get a roommate, but it is by no means in any way unlivable.
  
She is claiming that she requested that we evict our son because it made the house unsafe.  This stems from FB communications that she had with my wife, but it was never to that level that I am aware of.  They fight a lot.  Both of them do things they should not.  Apparently police have been there more than once but I was never informed as to any tenant being a threat to anyone by them.
  
She is claiming that she no longer owes rent for June or July due to this.  I considered that she was gone at the end of June and only wanted half of June rent from her.  But now she is stating that July 15th is her 30 day move out notice.  So from my point of view, she now has legally admitted to owing me half of June, July and one quarter of August rent.   
  
We have a loosely written lease that lists only Son and DIL as tenants.  They have had roommates on occasion but as far as I am concerned, the rent is from them only.  Any rent agreements from a roommate would be between them and not include me from my point of view.
  
She is also stating that if I try to collect rent from her, she will file against my homeowner's insurance due to ""unsafe tenants"".  In addition she claims she will file against them for any of ""her"" possessions that are damaged or destroyed.  From my point of view, I have NO horse in that race.  How can I be liable for their inability to split goods I never owned in the first place?  If she tries to take the washer and drier, what are my options?  They replaced them and threw away mine without notice.
  
The final roommate is a paralegal and sent us a photo of her room when she moved out in order to cover her ass which is fine.  The room looked OK in the photo.
  
So how much of her letter is bullshit?  Am I entitled to rent from her for half of June, half of July and one quarter of August?  Can she file claims against my homeowner's insurance?  Does anything at all that she claims in her letter hold water legally?",1
"Family is mooching off my disabled father. He's at his wits end, how does he get them out?. Florida. My father collects disability and hardly gets by as it is. He rents a small trailer that's 3 bedroom 2 bath. It's not much, but it's his. He doesn't get food stamps or other assistance other than disability. I have a sister in the area that has 2 girls and 1 stepson. They bought a fix it up house in the area. For the last couple years they let everything go. No ac, no refrigerator, no heat, and the water was undrinkable. The stepson is in the care of the biological grandmother. My sister lets call her, lazy and her boyfriend (father of her 2nd daughter) let's call him doofus. Well they would randomly come over to my dads house unannounced to stay the night because their power would constantly get shut off. Of course my dad would them and the girls stay. It would usually just happen for a couple of days here and there. Over time they stopped having people over. Later it was discovered how bad the house got. Fleas biting you constantly, and the mess was apparently terrible. My other sister made a surprise visit and just broke down into tears. She immediately just started cleaning. We thought that the situation was getting better but soon after thy showed up at my dads house because the power got shut off again. This was back in February. They are still there. My dad was currently caring for my 17 year old sister who just turned 18, graduated and moved in with me to start college in Nevada. The oldest daughter is currently with me. I don't have custody, but my sister let me have her for the summer. I just got permission to let her stay with me until she can get on her feet. Lazy and doofus eat all the food, pay $0 in bills causing my dad to borrow money constantly from family just so that the kids could eat food. Doofus works full time as a welder and apparently they can afford to move back home. My dad is being stepped all over just because they are living for free. The only bills they have is $300 for rent, electric and car insurance. They pay my dad nothing and even have their hand out for gas money. Lazy goes to a methadone clinic 1 1/2 hours away every other day costing them a lot in gas and of course money for the drug. All of their money seems to go toward this. I know that doofus smokes pot as well. They could go to a clinic closet to home but it's run by the government so they would actually have to go to meetings and whatnot. My dad offered to buy them a refrigerator, and reccently offered to pay their electric bill so they can move back into their old place. Doofus replied with, no reason to it will just get shut off again. The kids were going hungry and there was 6 people living in a small place. It was crazy. I now have the oldest daughter, and my 18 year old sister. I have no idea what I'm doing. Lazy said I can let her start school out her and whatever paperwork I need let me know and she'll sign it or whatever. I'll save that for another post. My poor sad is at his wits end. They are clearly taking advantage of him and he can't see the kids suffer so he does everything he can but it's not enough. He wants them out but who really wins? The second daughter will still be suffering and I can't take care of everyone. The issue here is that the landlord doesn't know doofus, lazy, and their daughter are staying there. It's supposed to be a single family home so he could get evicted. Can my dad still start an eviction notice? We could have to get CPS involved for second child but we are all scared because we are all stretched thin as it is and don't know who can actually care for her effectively. I just had a baby myself. I went from no one to 3 kids to take care of. I should also note that the fixer up house was bought by doofus's mom outright and they just pay her $300/month. That's why they haven't lost it. I'm sure she's upset she hasn't been getting paid, however, I'm not aware of any written contract or that she wants to sell or get rid of the house. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. I honestly have no idea what I'm doing. I'm just trying to scoop everyone up and take care of everyone, but I can't. They need a wake up call. They're older than me and sleeping in my dads couch. It's shameful to take advantage of my dad, and even more shameful to not even care for the kids. When the oldest came out here she didn't even have a pair of shoes to wear on the plane. This is bad. But they need to step up and take care of their family.",1
"Was pulled over, with weed in my car, and a well-known local ""crook."" What happens next is even crazier.. Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.

Last night, I was getting off of work at around 11:30pm.  I received a text from a former HS friend that he was stranded and needed a ride.  I don't hang out with this kid, virtually ever, and I haven't really even spoke to him much as of recent.  In all honesty, since HS really...  But I did run into him over the weekend, which is how we re-touched base and he mentioned to me that he was going through a bit of a rough patch, and to top it all off, didn't have a car because it was in the shop.

He texted me an address, and I figured since I was heading back toward that area it wouldn't help to pick the kid up.  I'm generally a very nice guy, sometimes too nice maybe.

Anyway, not within 45 seconds, as we were pulling away, a cop starts tailing me.  I turned once, and as soon as we approached a stoplight, his sirens go off.

Now initially I was a little confused, I wasn't sure why we were being pulled over.  Immediately my friend to the right of me goes ""aw fuck."" 

Apparently, he had some weed on him (not much, 4-5 grams), and ""forgot about it"" until the cop was right behind us with his sirens on.

So, I tried to stay calm.  I figured maybe this was just a fluke, a coincidence; that I had made a rolling stop or whatever.  Well, before I could even think the officer was asking me to step out of my vehicle.  He also KNEW the kid that I was with BY NAME, immediately, and wasn't surprised when he saw him in my car (which makes me realize that he probably saw me pick him up).

Still, I tried to stay collected.  I felt that I personally didn't have anything to hide, and while I was very nervous, I was calm in the fact that if I explained to the officer my situation, I wouldn't be the one in trouble.

Then he informed me that the area in which I picked him up in was one of the ""heavier areas for narcotics trade in the city.""  Immediately my heart sank and I realized that I may have been in some deeper shit than I had imagine.


Well, he asked to search my car.  Initially I told him I felt it wasn't necessary, to which the cop to the next of him IMMEDIATELY rings in the K9 unit.

I have a vast amount of respect for law enforcement.  I have many close friends who are police officers, and my uncle himself was a cop back in the day.  I didn't want them to have to waste their time and resources for this crap, so I changed my response.  I told the officers that after what I had heard about the area in which I picked my friend up, I became a little hesitant as I did not know what my friend had on him.  (I DID not rat him out, I'm not a fucking rat)

So, they searched my car.  My friend was taken out, they searched him too, and found nothing....  Which is when it hit me.  The guy left it in my car.

It took not 45 seconds for the cops to find the baggy in my center console, which apparently is where he left it.

And what do you know after this?  The mother fucker tries to pinpoint it on me, yelling phrases like ""OWN UP TO IT BRO, YOU KNOW IT'S NOT MINE"" blah blah blah, just a bunch of bullshit.

I still, stayed collective and said nothing.  I was always told growing up that ""the less you say to cops, the better.""

Well, a few seconds after that, I see him take my friend over to the sidewalk, where they empty the baggy out and crush it into the sidewalk (virtually destroying all evidence they had, which confused me).

He then, walked over, pointed at me and said ""you, get out of here.  Go home.""

I don't know how, or why the cop decided to bless me like he did, but jesus you know I got out of there as fast as I could.

I had a little aftershock about it throughout the day, but all in all I'm just very grateful that there truly are a lot of non-asshole cops out there.  

I did, however, receive a call from a private number around 8pm this evening.  I didn't answer, as I was working, and they didn't leave a message (however I think my mailbox may have been full as I'm currently applying to different jobs as I intend to finish school in December).

My question is, is there anyway I can still get into any trouble for what happened?  If the private number WAS indeed the police trying to contact me (for whatever reason), what should I do?  

Please help, as I may just be incredibly paranoid.  I just want to make sure that I know I'm in the clear from this so I'm not worrying about it over the course of the next 2 weeks.

Thank you",0
"[West Virginia] A dog in my neighborhood was unleashed and killed my therapy cat in front of me. The owner of the dog refused to pay for cremation costs, can I sue her for the price of the urn?. Sorry if my post is a little messy, this just happened yesterday and I've been a complete wreck.

A little backstory: my cat was about 13 or 15 years old (I can't recall what age I adopted him, I think I was 7 or 8), and I'd had him since he was about three weeks old, and we grew up together. I have severe anxiety due to mental illness, childhood abuse, and the death of my father, and he was classified as a therapy animal by my therapist who'd I'd been seeing for four years at that point. He was my best and only friend and I'm just beside myself.

On Sunday I let my cat outside (he had arthritis and liked to lie out in the sun for a couple of hours before coming inside, I guess it helped because he started walking better once it got sunny) and went about my day. Later as I was outside, I saw a huge Boxer dog carrying something in his mouth; once I realized it was my cat, I streaked across the lawns to the neighbor's house where I basically had to fight the dog off my cat so I could hold him as he died in my arms. I was inconsolable and traumatized. The owner wasn't present, but her mother was and assured me that she was sorry and informed me that the young child in the house had incorrectly tethered the Boxer dog to its chain, causing it to break out of its yard and run into mine, where it found my cat.

After wrapping my cat up and talking to the owner when she got home, she apologized and offered to pay for any bills, which I accepted. I called a vet, got an estimate for cremation, and everything at that point seemed as settled as it could be.

I walked to her house this morning as I was headed over to the vet appointment to ask her for the finances she offered, and she refused, saying she didn't have the money and that she has leukemia and simply doesn't make enough to cover the bills. I told her I was sorry that she was ill but she is responsible for my cat's death and she needed to take responsibility, and she told me to contact her attorney. My mom offered to pay for my cat's cremation, but now I don't have money for an urn to put the ashes in (the vet doesn't offer free urns so it would come in a sealed bag).

**Since she told me to take her to court, I'm here asking for advice. Here's a TL;DR bulletpoint with information**

**My therapy cat was killed by an unleashed Boxer dog and the owner refuses to take financial responsibility.**

* The leash law in West Virginia states: 

&gt; §19-20-13. Dog running at large; liability of owner. 
&gt; Any owner or keeper of any dog who permits such dog to run at large shall be liable for any damages inflicted upon the person or property of another by such dog while so running at* large.

* My city within West Virginia's leash law states:

&gt;  The City Code of Ordinances Chapter 4 states that ""no person shall allow any dog owned by him or in his custody to run at large within the city. The term ""running at large"" means allowing a dog to leave the property limits of property owned, leased or occupied by its owner without restraint. The term ""restraint"" means being secured by a leash or lead, or being under the control of a responsible person and obedient to that person's command.""

* The owner admitted fault and offered to pay for damages
* The owner then refused to pay for damages she previously offered
* The owner requested that I take her to court
* The owner verbally attacked me when I went to her house on Monday (I don't know if this is relevant but I'm including it)
* The owner admitted negligence in allowing her young child to handle a Boxer dog three times her size (again I don't know if this is relevant but she admitted to being negligent in this respect)
* The owner keeps three dogs in a 3x4 kennel in the backyard, which is way too small for the size of her dogs
* The owner admitted that her Boxer dog was actually looking for a different cat that has been wandering around her yard lately, so she admitted to knowledge that her dog had vicious intent but did nothing to prevent it

I can't think of anything else. I don't want pain and suffering money, I don't want to hurt her, I just want her to pay for the price of my cat's urn. I want to put this behind me so I can grieve my best friend. I haven't had a day of restful sleep or without crying and and wailing into a pillow for two days. I'm really hoping you guys have any advice, and I thank you in advance.",0
"[US] Girlfriend's new job gave no pay stubs, no lunch break, and no bathroom breaks.. To preface, we live in Georgia in the United States. My girlfriend is 19 years old. 

So my girlfriend was offered a job as a manager of a brand new store that was opening up at the beginning of July. This was the second of an already existing store in the town we live in. She was offered the manager position, $12 a hour, at least 40 hours a week, the freedom to make her own schedule, 5% of sales at the end of the year from both stores, and a bonus at the end of year. 

So they hired her and no contracts were signed before or after hiring. No official papers stating what she would be doing or that she worked there at all. She starts the job during her two week notice at her previous job. They ""train"" her, which was really just teaching her how to run the register and computer system and using her for labor. She was told to find employees to run the new store that would open roughly four weeks after she started. So I help her set up an online ad for the position of part time employee and numerous (probably 30) applications came in. 

She reached out to a few applicants to set up interviews only to be told it was completely up to her to hire these employees because they would be splitting her hours with her. So she decided to hire none and no interviews took place. During her time at the pre existing store she worked alone probably 80% of the time. Over 40 hours a week not by choice. 

So the new store opens up. It's a good 40 minute drive to the new location for everyone involved. She's scheduled to work everyday its open for the first week. And she works there with the owners daughter. (The only employees are the owner, owners daughter, my girlfriend, and someone who was hired not long after her to cover at the pre existing location). The daughter mentioned how the other employee would not work at the new location because she ""didn't have the look for it."" The owners daughter is very rude to my girlfriend as well. Always complaining about what she did the night before and telling her she should know how to do her job. The problem with that is, she received very little training if you could even call it that. Every day she would tell me how she got in trouble and sometimes openly in front of customers. 

Then comes the Fourth of July. She's running the store alone and is left a letter from the boss. The letter is two pages long front and back that states she has a learning curve and didn't train well. It also states that the boss never guaranteed 40 hours a week and that she wouldn't receive her bonus or percentage of sales. She even mentioned reducing her hours each week. 

So she texts me the letter and asks her parents and we all agree she should quit the job because it was nothing what they offered her and we felt she wasn't being treated properly. We believe she was used to make the drive to the new store because the owner and her daughter had no interest in doing it daily. That's just a theory however. 

So she texts the owners daughter that she quits and needs to come to the store to take over. She continued to work and help customers and make sales until the owners daughter arrived to relieve her. 

She worked 8-10 hour shifts alone in busy towns. She wasn't given an opportunity to go grab food or take a break. She couldn't use the bathroom unless there were no customers, which was rare and when there weren't she had to run to make sure no one came in. She was never given any pay stubs for any of her checks and in the letter the boss stated that she guesstimates her pay and overtime pay. I correctly calculated her overtime pay and it was double what she was actually paid. 

My question is: what here is illegal - if any of it is. I believe some of it may be and we're curious what we can do about it. Apparently someone heard about what happened to my girlfriend and said the same store and boss and did the exact same thing to another person previously. 

Sorry for the long patchy story. 

tl;dr: Girlfriend was offered a management job at a new store and was given zero management duties. She couldn't take a break to get food and eat and could rarely use the bathroom. Owner and her daughter were rude to her and told her another employee didn't have the look to work at the new store. She received zero pay stubs with checks and was underpaid for overtime hours. She also received a letter claiming she had a learning curve during training when they never properly trained her or worked with her enough to know how she was.",0
"I [31m/US/NE] am concerned about my child being psychologically abused by my ex [29f/US/TN]. In order to fully understand the level of confidence I have in the opinion that my daughter is being abused psychologically would take a very long time. I will give the highlights.

My ex and I got divorced due to deployment related stress in 2010 when my daughter was 2. She moved back and forth between TN and NE during my deployments and eventually, after the divorce, she settled back in NE because of better schools and better standard of living (Omaha vs Memphis).

During the time that she lived in NE, I was unable to see my daughter frequently both due to a refusal to cooperate from my ex and my continuing deployments.

I got out of the military and hoped it would be a good opportunity for me to make up with lost time, but I was met with the same lack of cooperation as before so I really only saw my daughter a couple times a year (always only at her mom's house).

I filed for a custody hearing, my ex never responded to the notification so we had the sheriff's office serve her. The day after we got our receipt of service, she moved to TN.

Since the proceedings, the lack of cooperation because a full force of loathing and spitefulness from her. Her dad wanted to fight me in front of my daughter and told me I wasn't allowed on his property. My ex has sworn at me and called me things like an asshole in front of my daughter. My ex's mom has said, in front of my daughter, that I abandoned her.

After many proceedings and a trial-style hearing on the record I was able to secure some visitation times including the school vacations. I was so excited to get her for the very first extended period since she was 2 years old, now she's 8. That excitement and blissfulness of being with my daughter is now accompanied with total anxiety.

My ex got our daughter a phone, she said that she's supposed to have to have the phone on her at all times both in TN and in NE, but I have a lot of evidence suggesting that she doesn't get her phone in TN (i.e. a complete wipe of my text messages and phone calls from her phone when she showed up here this summer).

Through conversation it is fairly obvious that my daughter has been coached about a lot of this stuff with the phone (i.e. how to always keep location on, to call her mom every morning and every night, and not letting me or my wife see the phone as well as password protecting it).

All things considered, it was really easy to get access to my 8 year old daughter's phone and the things that have been going on this summer are startling.

My ex has interrogated her nightly about her situation and what me and my wife do, more so than asking about what all she's been doing and if she's having fun or not.

She has consistently thrown shade on me over and over, though that is to be expected I guess. I am the type that tells the truth to my daughter unless it could negatively impact their relationship, I'm not about that bullshit shade-throwing.

She told my daughter only to speak to her when she can be away from me and my wife and is always asking if either one of us have had access to her phone.

In the last few weeks my daughter has really warmed up to being here and has put her phone on the back-burner most of the time. She's fucking 8 years old and she doesn't give a shit about the phone, she just worries that she's going to be in trouble if she doesn't keep it on her (she's told me so).

During those few weeks she has been unresponsive at times that she's having a sleepover or she left her phone at home. On nights that she doesn't respond, my ex is very harsh.

During a vacation to Texas my daughter left her phone in the car overnight. The next morning, my ex had sent her a text before she went to work saying that she was up all night crying and didn't get any sleep because she didn't hear from her.

Tonight, she threatened to call the cops because she wasn't responding and had her FBI ex-boyfriend blowing up her phone as well.

1) I have all of these things from her phone backed up, but I don't own the phone. The communications are taking place in my house and concern my child. Is that information admissible in an informal hearing setting... I know that if I were able to subpoena the records from the phone company that would be admissible during a trial, I just want to know if I'm going to be breaching any privacy laws by having the information (hence the throwaway).

2)I'm legitimately freaked out about what my daughter is going through, what the fuck can I do to stop it?

Thanks for the help.",0
"[Pennsylvania] Interim Distribution of Grandparent's Estate: Safe to Deposit the Check?. I wanted to apologize before hand, as I have never dealt with a situation like this before and I may be mixing terms up. If anything is unclear I'll explain to the best of my ability.

I recently received a letter in the mail regarding my deceased grandfather's estate that I was included in the Will for. It included a check for my portion of the estate.The letter stated the following verbatim:

&gt;We represent ****, executor of the estate of ****, Deceased. At this time, we are in a position to make a partial distribution of the amount bequeathed to you under **** will.

&gt;There are insufficient funds available in the estate to make full distributions. Accordingly, we are distributing funds at the pro rata amount of fifty percent of the amount bequeathed. Enclosed please fund two copies of a Receipt, Release, Indemnification, and Refunding Agreement for your review and signature. If you agree with the Receipt and Release document, please sign one copy in the presence of a Notary Public and return it to me in the envelope provided. The second copy is for your records. I have also enclosed an estate check payable to your order representing the amount due you as indicated in the release document.

&gt;One the estate is completed, we will be sending you an additional pro rata distribution of the balance of the estate. If you have any questions concerning the enclosed materials, please feel free to contact me at the telephone number listed above.

The letter then continued to the Receipt, Release, Indemnification and Refunding Agreement that said the following terms:

&gt;NOW, THEREFORE, the undersigned, beneficiary, intending to be legally bound, hereby:
1. Declares that he/she has read this instrument and that the facts set forth above are true and correct to the best of his/her knowledge, information and belief;
2. Requests the Executor to distribute the sum indicated to him/her and the acknowledges receipt of such distribution to him/her effective upon delivery to him/her;
3. Releases ad discharges the Executor and his successors from all further liability, responsibility, and accountability with respect to such distribution to him/her;
4. Agrees to refund all or any part of such distribution to him/her if it shoulder later be found that distribution was due to mistake (either innocent of negligent) is that all or part of it should have been paid to others or that taxes or other charges should have first been paid;
5. Agrees to indemnify the Executor against any and all liability, loss or expense (included, but not limited to, counsel fees) that the Executor may ever incur as a result of the distribution to him/her without first securing an award by the Court having jurisdiction over it;
6. Agrees that any claim under this agreement may be brought in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, agrees to submit to the jurisdiction thereof, and waives any objection to the jurisdiction thereof;
7. Declares it to be his/her intent that this instrument shall be governed by Pennsylvania law and shall be legally binding on him/her and on his/her executors, administration, heirs, successors, and assigns; and
8. Agrees that any period for the limitation of actions for the collection of any erroneous distribution to him/her shall commence only at such time as the Executor shall have obtained actual knowledge of such erroneous distribution and that in no event shall the period for collection of any erroneous distribution be less than two years after the actual discovery thereof by the Executor. 

My major question here is to ask if anything above suggests that I should wait to deposit the check included with these documents and if I should have the Receipt, Release, Indemnification and Refunding Agreement signed and sent prior to doing so. Also, for an ELI5 of the terms I'd be agreeing to. I ask this because the executor of the will has done some cheap, questionable things in the past that have given his siblings and I reason to be suspicious that he might do something to exploit these terms. He also works for the firm that sent and wrote up these documents.

TL;DR-I received documents (detailed above) and a check from the firm handling the estate of my grandfather and wanted to make sure everything seems kosher since my Uncle who is the executor has been a shyster in the past. I also wanted to know if it is okay for me to deposit the check sent to me right away and when the appropriate time to send the signed documents back to the firm.",0
"Landlord is threatening to evict, but I've never lived inside he property. I'm suing so I want to know what I'm heading in to.. I'll try to make this short. 
A notoriously crooked landlord leased a property to me that was being remodeled for foundation and roofing purposes. 
Contract states that the lease started on June 1st which is the day the landlord said the construction would be finished, and we are to pay rent at the first of every month of course. The property has not floor in two of the rooms and some of the roof is missing. 
City wrote a notice to landlord to seize all construction for the absence of permits that were require to do construction, which I later found out that the landlord was notified of that about a month prior to leading me the property. 
Three days after the lease was to begin I saw absolutely no progress made on the house, and had no way of moving in. He never even gave me keys after he told me the keys would be in a locked compartment in the house. So I called the landlord numerous times with voicemails and of course he never answered. So I knew I was going to have to take legal action. 
I sent a certified return receipt letter to his office about a week and a half to two weeks after the lease was suppose to start stating that he breached contract, refuse to communicate with me and that I wanted all of my money back, fully expecting him not to answer or acknowledge anything. Upon doing research at this point, the landlord had been arrested a few times, was notorious for making crooked deals like this with many tenants and then screwing them over, and had been on the news a time or two for the attention he was getting. It was so bad that there is a Facebook group dedicated to putting a stop to this POS since he continues to do this to more people everyday. 
I filed a lawsuit about two weeks after that, which was the same day I went to check the property once more seeing that still nothing had been done, and when he was served the process from the court the landlord finally called me. Landlord was shocked and suddenly so accommodating and was offering to settle since he thought it was ""unnecessary"" to bring this matter to court. I told him the parameters on which we were to settle on and then asked me to email him what he owed me. So I did and stated that he should have a check/money order mailed in five to six days by noon on the sixthish day and upon cashing in the check I would gen drop the suit and we would go our separate ways. He never replied of course, so I called him a few times those following days. No answer, but I didn't trust to settle out of court with a crooked guy like this. I texted the landlord lord on the due date of the settlement saying that if he still wants to settle I will be happy to come by his office so he can write me a check or I would see him in court, and he replied with ""busy today"". 
So I then had the idea of getting him on record via phone call, knowing he had more crooked dealing to serve me and proceeded to call a few days after he texted me until he answer. I called once a day from three more days and on the third day, he returned my called. So I pressed record. 
Landlord told me that I made it difficult to settle with all of my demands and due dates and said that his lawyer looked the email over and said ""we can win this no problem"". I laughed because he was obviously trying to scare me and then asked ""what is there for you to win? You've already taken about 4 thousand dollars from me thus far. What is there left?"" He said if i took 500 dollars off that amount then he would write a check for me and the suit will be dropped. He followed with, ""If the check bounced or anything then you have full recourse. My lawyer will set all of this up, but you have to take 500 dollars off for my lawyer fee."" Of course I said no way in hell knowing that the damages I was suing for were more than what I had already paid and he followed with ""you know this isn't going to be a short process suing me right? It'll take 5-6months, because it isn't just an eviction process. In fact, I can actually file an eviction against you and then put it on your credit record."" That set me off because of course I never lived there. I proceeded to curse him and told him to go ahead and evict me because I never lived in the property and the property itself is proof that no one could have lived there and that he'll have to lawyer up big time if he's going to take it that direction. 

He hung up. 
So I have that on record now but as far as suing and what to expect, that's my main concern. What am I getting myself into?",1
"Busted for Mary Jane in Idaho and scared!. So, I'm scared, as you can tell by the title. Why? I live in Idaho and they're very strict with their laws containing marijuana. I was driving home from work at 12am, on a Sunday and was extremely tired. Someone (I wasn't paying much attention to anyone following me as I was just trying to get home and go to sleep) was following me home and called me in as a DUI because I was swerving on the road. I get home and get ready to snuggle in my bed from a long 8 hour shift when I hear a knock on the door. Now, I live with my parents so the first thing I did was run to my parents room and tell them there was someone knocking on our door but i told them it didn't sound as if it was a cop. (I thought it was our neighbor.) My parents go to the door and they ask for me. I come to the door and they flash a flashlight at me and ask if I am drinking or have been drinking. I reply ""no, I just got off work and I'm tired"" they ask me a couple other questions and then finally told me that they knew I wasn't under the influence. They didn't give me a sobriety test either. I explained that I was tired from a long shift which caused me to swerve on the road. THIS IS WHERE IT WENT DOWN. He asked for my drivers license and walked to my car with me. I opened my door and he immediately says my car reeks of marijuana. I act somewhat dumb knowing I had some from a previous incident. He asks if he can search my car (me being dumb, let's him search) he finds a little purse with a bag of marijuana (a gram or less) and my grinder (which I bought at a 18+ tabacoo shop.) Also, I'm 18 if that helps with anything. He then says he won't arrest me as it's minor and he has better things to do. He understood that I was a good kid and said he hopes to see me in a few years with a badge on and promised that he wouldn't judge me for this. I'm going to school for criminal justice (yes, I know. Stupid discussion making on my part. I already know and have already knocked myself down for it. All I can do is learn from this.) I have nothing on my adult record (I had diversion when I was 15 for alcohol but finished the program.) He then wrote me a citation for possession of marijuana and possession of phara. There was also a date on the citation as to when I need to call the clerk of justice to schedule a court date. I'm so scared as I've already mentioned. I want to be a detective/profiler and I'm currently going to school for criminal justice as my major and psychology as my minor. I work two jobs and also volunteer for my community to help better my experience when I want to apply for a future job. Just have a couple questions I feel I need answered to relive my stress/anxiety I'm having. Some you may or may not know the answers to but if you've had previous experience with these charges, your experience and knowledge would be very appreciated. What should I expect at my court date? I'm going to plea guilty (I can't afford a lawyer and I really just don't think it'll help me in the long run.) Would it be considered my second offense since I got diversion when I was 15? Or would it be considered my first offense as I'm now an ""adult?"" Should I be taking online or in person drug and alcohol classes to be proactive about my charges before I appear in court? Would that look good to the judge or be a waste of time and money? Will I go to jail? (Super scared about this.) Since it's my first adult offense, could it play out that I go to court and he/she just issues me a fine to pay and I move on with my life? (I know that's very unlikely but I'm just trying to hope for a light in this darkness.) Would I likely be going on unsupervised probation or supervised probation for these charges? I was also going to bring any further information that would show I'm not just some stoner who doesn't do anything with their life like - my two scholarships I recently received my senior year of high school, a copy of my diploma showing I graduated high school, my top scholar reward I received from my school, proof of my high GPA? It could mean nothing to him or her but would it help me in any factor? Any additional advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm nervous, scared, and ashamed. I don't need to hear that I made a mistake. I'm very aware and won't be repeating this mistake ever again. I talked to a couple people at my school and they said it won't effect my schooling. I know it's just marijuana but it's my career that I'm scared for. It wasn't worth it. My future/career is so much more important. Thank you for taking the time to read. I hope it made some sense. I'm nervously typing.",0
"[Texas] Landlord is threaten to evict me, but I've never lived there due to uninhabitable conditions. I'm suing and want to know what I'm heading for.. I'll try to make this short. 
A notoriously crooked landlord leased a property to me that was being remodeled for foundation and roofing purposes. 
Contract states that the lease started on June 1st which is the day the landlord said the construction would be finished, and we are to pay rent at the first of every month of course. The property has not floor in two of the rooms and some of the roof is missing. 
City wrote a notice to landlord to seize all construction for the absence of permits that were require to do construction, which I later found out that the landlord was notified of that about a month prior to leading me the property. 
Three days after the lease was to begin I saw absolutely no progress made on the house, and had no way of moving in. He never even gave me keys after he told me the keys would be in a locked compartment in the house. So I called the landlord numerous times with voicemails and of course he never answered. So I knew I was going to have to take legal action. 
I sent a certified return receipt letter to his office about a week and a half to two weeks after the lease was suppose to start stating that he breached contract, refuse to communicate with me and that I wanted all of my money back, fully expecting him not to answer or acknowledge anything. Upon doing research at this point, the landlord had been arrested a few times, was notorious for making crooked deals like this with many tenants and then screwing them over, and had been on the news a time or two for the attention he was getting. It was so bad that there is a Facebook group dedicated to putting a stop to this POS since he continues to do this to more people everyday. 
I filed a lawsuit about two weeks after that, which was the same day I went to check the property once more seeing that still nothing had been done, and when he was served the process from the court the landlord finally called me. Landlord was shocked and suddenly so accommodating and was offering to settle since he thought it was ""unnecessary"" to bring this matter to court. I told him the parameters on which we were to settle on and then asked me to email him what he owed me. So I did and stated that he should have a check/money order mailed in five to six days by noon on the sixthish day and upon cashing in the check I would gen drop the suit and we would go our separate ways. He never replied of course, so I called him a few times those following days. No answer, but I didn't trust to settle out of court with a crooked guy like this. I texted the landlord lord on the due date of the settlement saying that if he still wants to settle I will be happy to come by his office so he can write me a check or I would see him in court, and he replied with ""busy today"". 
So I then had the idea of getting him on record via phone call, knowing he had more crooked dealing to serve me and proceeded to call a few days after he texted me until he answer. I called once a day from three more days and on the third day, he returned my called. So I pressed record. 
Landlord told me that I made it difficult to settle with all of my demands and due dates and said that his lawyer looked the email over and said ""we can win this no problem"". I laughed because he was obviously trying to scare me and then asked ""what is there for you to win? You've already taken about 4 thousand dollars from me thus far. What is there left?"" He said if i took 500 dollars off that amount then he would write a check for me and the suit will be dropped. He followed with, ""If the check bounced or anything then you have full recourse. My lawyer will set all of this up, but you have to take 500 dollars off for my lawyer fee."" Of course I said no way in hell knowing that the damages I was suing for were more than what I had already paid and he followed with ""you know this isn't going to be a short process suing me right? It'll take 5-6months, because it isn't just an eviction process. In fact, I can actually file an eviction against you and then put it on your credit record."" That set me off because of course I never lived there. I proceeded to curse him and told him to go ahead and evict me because I never lived in the property and the property itself is proof that no one could have lived there and that he'll have to lawyer up big time if he's going to take it that direction. 

He hung up. 
So I have that on record now but as far as suing and what to expect, that's my main concern. What am I getting myself into?",1

"Can I face eviction for cutting off lessors unauthorized use of our business internet?. I'm a new small business in Pennsylvania and tenant that was transferred ownership of an existing business franchise. We discovered building maintenance using our private internet business network for the separate apartment residences above, building security cameras and keypad entry for tenants. Can I face eviction for cutting off lessors unauthorized use of our business internet?

After discovering the internet use I cut them off because it was causing massive malware and email problems which shut our business down intermittently over a period of two weeks or more as our corporate representative was setting up our store, and it stopped after blocking their IP address through our service provider router software.

I contacted maintenance via text message of my findings with a photo of the unknown cabling on our network, which lied to me about my finding, saying it was only for power until I finally asked a series of questions (because it didn't make sense) and he finally admitted that it was for internet use and claims he had an verbal agreement (not in lease) with the previous owner and after following up on that claim, the owner never would have agreed to internet use. It turns out they were connected to our network switch 3-4 years prior without consent of previous owner, and used our service as new owners for a period of about 30 days.

Since then they've harassed, retaliated and stonewalled us by not maintaining the building, physically and verbally threatened us inside our business space twice and police reports have been made.

The first time the mainentance came in without notification and got in my face in front of my customers, who saw what was happening and responded by getting up to defend me, claiming we were now using the buildings electricity to power our network equipment.

The second time we called a formal meeting between property manager and maintenance to discuss responsibilities of both parties as new tenants and clarification as we are riding out the existing lease on the previous owners personal guarantee and landlords and franchise consent. The maintenance manager nearly came across the counter at me in anger and called me out to fight in the street. The property manager asked maintenance to leave the meeting afterwards. I called the police a few hours later after calming down. Ultimately, we agreed to put the equipment in our space to stop use of building electricity. We made arrangements hired IT service and requested equipment move from our service provider to relocate the equipment to our space.

Service provider was able to do their move and the IT services later that day was locked out of the area and not allowed to finish which left network cabling running on the high-traffic floor which creates a trip hazard which property manager admits in an email that should suffice and doesn't need to be bothered anymore. We tried all avenues to bring this matter to a close; IT services was told that we are not the tenant and never returned their calls or email requests; Previous owner was not able to reason with property manager; our attorney who is a customer called on our behalf; city police also called maintenance from our storefront and nothing will make them comply.

The property manager has high level position (we assume managing partner of building) with a large commercial real estate company who is responsible for that individuals brokerage license. This individual has a web page with many accreditations, but after following up on many of them we've discovered that we couldn't even file a complaint with the realtors associations because there was no current licences under that name. Also we've discovered that our rent checks are deposited to an entirely different account number and name than the LLC on the lease. The building maintenance and property manager are clearly in a relationship, but not openly, which is possibly a conflict of interest among the other ethical violations we've experience from this property manager and staff.

The property manager is now trying to get me to sign an assumption of lease after 6 months of us taking over the lease and the previous owner did notify her of the business transfer, introducing us partners as new business owners. We pay our monthly rent on time, are for responsible in the lease, among other things, for an HVAC unit with a value of about $10,000 however we are afraid they won't let our HVAC technician in to service the unit since they refused to let the IT technicians finish the job that was at their request. We only want to run our new business and are happy with the location and didn't want to disrupt the relationship with the property manager and maintenance.",1
"[CA] Did I experience housing discrimination?. Please excuse the length of this post, but I'm trying to be thorough and make sure I don't leave anything out. My (37/M) friend (27/M)'s job has transferred him to my city, and since my current lease was ending, we made the decision to move in together to save money and upgrade to a nicer home. We had both been living in cramped studio apartments in order to save money and were tired of the lack of space, so we looked for homes with decent square footage that suited our needs in our price range. We fell in love with a 4 br, 3 ba, 3000+ sq ft home in a nice, quiet suburban neighborhood not far from where I was living at the time.

We paid our application fees, submitted our forms, and were told by the property managers after their review that everything looked great. We satisfied all of their requirements on paper. Our combined income is more than 3.5 times the rent (they only asked for 2.5 x), we both have good credit, no debts, no criminal history, and solid rental history with no evictions, bankruptcies, or judgements. All of our landlord and employer references are good. We are quiet non-smokers. The only potential issue was that the listing stated that the owner preferred no pets and we have two cats, but the landlord okayed them (in writing) as long as we agreed to a $500 deposit per cat. She emailed the property managers to request that she meet us in person before having us sign a lease, writing to them that she just needed 15 minutes to get a ""quick impression"", and finished the email by saying, ""if the meeting goes well, they can move in this weekend"". This email was forwarded to us by the property managers, and I set a time to meet the landlord through them.

We met at the home a few days later, and I don't think anything about my appearance should have been off-putting (I was well-groomed, wearing smart casual clothes, and my car is extremely clean). She had a negative vibe from the start and I got the impression that she didn't want to rent to us and was looking for me to prove her wrong. She made it clear that she would prefer to rent to a family, and said that she felt the only reason that two single men would want her home was to throw parties (I'm 37, and the landlord is only a year older than I am) or to move in lots of additional tenants. I tried to assuage her fears and explain why we wanted the space and told her what the rooms would be used for (a study, a workout room, a guest room, etc) and she seemed a little more relaxed when we parted ways.

After a few days of hearing nothing, I received an email from the property manager informing me that the homeowner had chosen another applicant to rent the house. I accepted this, but the following day I came across the property listing during my search for another home to rent and saw that it was still active. Out of curiosity, I checked the listing on various broker websites (Zillow, Trulia, etc) as well as the property management company's website every day for the next week, and it stayed up and remained active throughout this time. I know that these websites are sometimes slow to update, but other homes I'd considered during my search were speedily removed when they went off the market so I found this a little odd. At this point, a friend of mine contacted the property manager inquiring about the house and was told that it was still available for rent.

I wonder if some subtle discrimination has occurred here. We are a pair of professional adults, not a group of teens in their first house looking to party. As far as I am aware, it is illegal in California (where we are located) to deny housing to a qualified applicant because of their familial status, marital status, age, or any arbitrary status. I know that small/private landlords may be exempt from fair housing laws at the federal level, but I'm not sure if they are exempt from local and state laws. I am also concerned that some more sinister discrimination might be at play, as my roommate has a Hispanic name and is a legal alien from a South American country. He's lived in the US for most of his life, speaks perfect English, is gainfully employed, and is working on obtaining his citizenship - but I know this is still not enough for some people.

We were told that the home was being held for us until it suddenly wasn't. No offer was made by the property managers to show us other properties or refund our application fees, which they definitely were not obligated to do, but it might have been courteous considering the situation. We're happily in a new home now so I'm no longer interested in renting this property, but I'm still bothered by what happened. Is this a matter that I should pursue further, or do local/state/federal laws entitle a landlord to deny qualified applicants because of their family status and her personal feelings?",1
"[AL] Just found out that I am the officer of a decade long abandoned corporation my father made. I am currently in FL, but the corp exists in AL.

tl;dr- In the late 90s, my dad created a ""Domestic Corporation"" (has the .inc at the end) when I was a minor, used it to do some masonry work, and then passed away in the early 2000s. Thanks to Google, I just found out that I'm named as an officer (incorporator) and it still exists.

--------------------------------

Setting: small semi-rural town in Alabama. 

So, back in the late 90s my father had an opportunity to take the masonry he worked as a 9-5 job and use it to form his own company and take on some really big projects. I was in 8th grade at the time. He created the corp with the help of a lawyer friend, rented a little shed somewhere for cheap and got to work with my grandfather on the first project. It didn't make massive money, but it made enough for him to quit his day job and keep the lights on, and that's all that mattered.

For the most part, I never got involved except for helping him work out at his shop after school some days, and sometimes during summers in high school. He had a lot to do, it was hard work to do alone and he had no help (never hired anyone; it was always just him), so I was happy to lend a hand. 

That said, I was never officially paid in any capacity. This was just the ""family business"" and I was doing my duty as his kid to help keep the lights on. I didn't mind.

By college, in the early 2000s, I pretty much went on about my own life, and the help I could offer decreased pretty greatly because of my own responsibilities.

Around that time, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and stopped working. He kept his warehouse, just paying rent to keep it around (I guess to keep the hope alive that he would be able to do it again one day), but in 2008 he passed away. After his passing, his widow (my stepmother) mentioned that the shop was still around and she was going to have to pay rent on it if it wasn't cleaned out, so I took some friends down and sweeped/washed it out, threw out the old tables, and brought whatever was left over back to her (the vast majority of the equipment he used was rented, so all that was left over were some old pallets, old wooden tables he cobbled together to do work on, and mechanic hoist that I took back to her). 

That was the last I ever thought of his corp.

Well, last night I was just sitting there being somewhat sentimental and thought to myself ""I wonder if anyone talks about the work he did anymore..."" and Googled his corp name. While looking, I ran across a Google business listing and clicked it. According to the site- the corp is still listed as ""Exists"" and it has 2 officers... my father and ME (both listed as ""incorporator).

After some panicking, I went to the AL corp lookup and looked the company up via ID there, and sure enough the information was legit. It is listed as a ""Domestic Corporation"" and has a "".inc"" at the end of the name. 

I had always assumed that it was his company alone, and that when he passed the corp would be shut down. And yet there it is. From what I can tell, Alabama will never administratively shut down a corporation on its own.

After looking, I realized that Alabama requires a minimum $100 annual filing fee each year (subject to fines each month you don't deal with it). Obviously no one has dealt with this since at LEAST 2008, and that's assuming he kept it up as he should have up until 2007. The registered agent is still listed as him, and pointed to his shop. The mailing address is some PO Box I don't even recognize (I guess he got his work mail there). 

Now, before anyone jumps to the obvious conclusion of ""This could have been nefarious"" - that wasn't something my father would do in ill will. The man would have taken a bullet for me, and DID sacrifice a lot of his own personal life and happiness to care for me. Also, I am intimately familiar with my credit, and nothing has ever shown up out of the ordinary on it. When he did this, I'm sure he did it for no other reason than he thought it would be ""cool"" for his son to be a part business owner at such a young age. And, unfortunately, I can't remember that conversation at all (it's been some 20 years...), so 8th grade me probably thought it was really cool, too.

In short- kinda freaking out. There is this corporation out there, somewhere, that I am an officer in which has been sitting derelict since at least 2008 amounting what I can only assume is a lot of debt. I have none of the paperwork (that I am aware of), and know little more than the name of the company and that it's my responsibility now.

I'm pretty sure this is lawyer territory, but it's Sunday afternoon and my stomach is doing cartwheels, so I wanted to ask what you all thought since I have literally nothing else I can do right now about the situation.

Thanks!",0
"Rental/eviction help (unlawful tenant, not me) [NV] &lt;Text wall&gt;. I apologize if this is in the wrong sub, but I'm having a hard time locating one more appropriate on mobile at work.

A note about the situation: my roommate currently is not on the lease. I am. This is in Nevada. My girlfriend is also not on the lease but lives there with my verbal agreement. My son is visiting from out of town. The roommate in question is an extremely heavy drinker, felon, and has tendencies toward anger and manipulation.

So this has been a long couple of weeks. For the past few months my roommate has been moving from disrespectful to rude to harassing to threatening. My schedule recently shifted from late nights to early mornings and I asked him to respect that. Since then I've averaged about 4-6 hours of sleep per night, damaging my work and personal relationships. He contributes to that in a large way by slamming doors throughout the house, harassing me, making noise in communal areas right next to my room (which I can't close the door to because the air conditioner doesn't blow to my room), and making phone calls on speaker right outside my door.

Essentially I broke recently when he was standing in my doorway calling me names while my son was sleeping on an air mattress at the foot of my bed because we're uncomfortable with him being around my roommate lately. 

I asked him to leave the next day via text and he responded with ""I get mail there."" I sent him a text that said ""consider this your 30 days notice."" Then he said he would stay the duration of the lease, dropping it down to September at the absolute earliest. His sudden change of gears had me thinking something was up.

He came home that night and said he never received any notice asking him to leave and he absolutely refuses to leave under any circumstance and he has been researching his legal rights as a tenant. He also said he never harassed me as I had no proof or recorded evidence as it never happened (except non-emergency police confirmed the next day my suspicions that my live-in girlfriend who witnessed this harassment could constitute legal evidence and sign a statement saying otherwise). He said try to make him leave and I was living in a fantasy world where nothing I say is real. I took screen shots of everything he said that night and my polite terms of his exit from the apartment.

Later that night I got a text that said essentially he was sorry for being such a jerk and he appreciates the 30 days and he would be out as soon as he could.

After more research, it looked like my notice wouldn't hold legal weight if I left it at a text message. Everyone I talked to said he probably realized I had no legal leg to stand on and in 30 days when I asked him to leave as per his agreement he could change his mind and I'd be stuck for another 30 days. So I looked up what was required and got essentially a form letter off the internet giving him date of service, date of exit, reason for eviction, and a witness signature. I saw on the website that it wasn't necessary to get it notarized if there was a witness. I had my dad (only person in town who he didn't know personally that I could grab on short notice) serve it to him at work (the only place I could track him down as he spent only late evening hours at home when I had to be asleep for work). I understand this was probably uncomfortable for him but at the same time, I'm at the point where I nearly broke my lease because He's impossible to live with.

Last night his sister (my good friend who introduced us as we both needed a place and it was convenient) called me to inform me that my service was unlawful and he could escalate it if he desired and ""hopefully he won't."" That he had apologized before the moment of service and there was no reason to serve him, let alone a non-notarized notice to evict which he could sue me for fraud by serving that to him. I really want to call her and tell her that was unfair but now I'm not sure what good that would do. I also have about $250-300 worth of stuff at her house that I want to get back if I'm going to not be able to go over there anymore but don't want to worsen the situation.

I feel broken and tired and can't think straight anymore and I'm exhausted physically and mentally. I just need some advice if anyone has any. I know it probably doesn't sound like much of a big deal to everyone else but I've spent the last 6+ months spending 95% of my time in my room avoiding this guy and his rules and yelling and insults and I don't feel safe in the apartment.

Sorry if this is disjointed, I just woke up and started spewing out as much as I could think to put down. I would appreciate any advice on how to proceed.

TL;DR:
My roommate refused to leave when I asked, then changed his mind, then I served him with a 30-days notice his sister called and claimed I could be sued for fraud with.",1
"Legal issue from court ordered alcohol out parties to treatment. I caught a dui case in January of 2017. I was sentenced to a year probation and was told to get an alcohol assessment and I am required to follow the recommendations from the alcohol assessment. Below is my story.




Jan 26 2017 I had an appointment with a lady named Katie at dawn farms for my alcohol assessment. I was court ordered to have an alcohol assessment. During the assessment, Katie recommended that I do 24 weeks of outpatient group therapy at dawn farms with a lady named Hannah on wednesdays from 2-3:30. Katie was training a young lady and explained the rules and asked if I had any questions regarding the assessment. She asked me to sign a piece of paper confirming everything that we went over and that I was to attend 24 weeks of outpatient meetings as well as attend 2 aa meetings per week.  I attended the 24 weeks with no issue. After the first 12 weeks, I didn't get a review over my performance or acknowledged on how I did. I was just given a piece of paper that I had to write new goals on and that was it. After completing the 24 weeks on July 12th 2017, Hannah mentioned to me that I could either continue to do the Wednesday's 2pm groups or switch to Thursday's.  There was never a discussion I had with anyone from Dawn Farms regarding another 12 weeks. The program has two phases, recovery group support and recovery support. One is 24 weeks and the other is 12. Not everyone does 36 weeks, or 24 weeks. Some people do 12 weeks but everyone signs the same form that states that in order to complete the Dawn farms program, you have to do 36 weeks. There are check marks next to both phases that you are recommended to do. My contract had the recovery support phase checked off and had it wrote by Katie in pen ""2 sets of 12=24 weeks"". I was not court ordered to complete the program, I was court ordered to get an assessment and to attend the recommended meetings that were given to me during the assessment. Every individual is different went it comes to the assessment. Katie might recommend something completely different than what another person might recommend, but she did my intake and no one else did. And since everyone is different, she assessed me based on the information I provided her and made the decision to give me 24 weeks of outpatient therapy. And That was her job but she no longer works there.

On July 14th I went to dawn farms at about 3:10 to speak with someone who could help me better understand why the piece of paper says something different than what was said to me from Hannah. A lady gave me a card and told me to speak to ray, who is the coordinator of the program.

I got ahold of ray at about 5pm and spoke with him about the issue. I explained to him the piece of paper and he said Katie may have screwed up with my intake. I told him that was not my fault, but we can't talk to her anyways because she no longer works there. Did she really screw up? These are done on an individual basis. He said that things may have changed from when I originally signed the paper in January. I told him that if that was the case then I was to sign a new form.  He told me that he wants to talk to his staff about this to make sure there are no loop holes like this again. This is not considered a loophole if this is something that they recommend to other people in treatment. This does not seem fair. Everyone who signs the same form would have to do 36 weeks. I was planning on signing up for classes at washtenaw community college. How am I suppose to plan things out for myself if there is a lack of communication and a lack of review after the 12 week period? He said that he would not write a letter saying that I completed the 36 weeks at dawn farms. I never asked him to write a letter to be dishonest and say that i did something I didn't do. I told him I want him to write a letter stating that I completed my 24 week recovery support group at dawn farm. I told him I would pick it up next week.



In terms of the dawn farms client handbook, it states that the staff will not lie to you or emotionally or physically abuse you. I feel like I was lied to and it's emotionally hurtful to know that I was mislead and it's causing me anxiety. I should feel good about being sober, not bad. I haven't had any screw ups since I've been at Dawn Farms. 



Dawn farms website states ""Group therapy – Several group therapy options are offered that are designed to help clients with varying needs, levels of motivation and intensity of substance use problems. Groups range in duration from 8 to 24 weeks depending upon client needs and preference.""



If I signed a contract for leasing a vehicle for 24 months. That's what I would expect. I wouldn't expect the dealer to call me at the 24 month period to tell me that things changed and that it was actually a 36 month lease without me being aware.",0
"[TURKEY, USA CA]Newegg took my money to pay customs duties, import and sales taxes on my behalf but failed to do so, I'm getting charged for custom fees again.. I live in Turkey, I have ordered around 1860$(with taxes and shipment) worth of computer parts from newegg.com/global/tr.

**TLDR;** At https://www.newegg.com/global/ page they say ""During the order checkout process, Newegg will calculate and display the order total amount along with cost of customs duties and applicable import and sales tax (VAT/GST). Should you elect to proceed with completing the purchase, all orders will be delivered with duty and tax fully paid for and included in your final checkout price."" and at https://kb.newegg.com/Article/Index/12/3?id=1400 page ""When Newegg products are shipped to eligible countries, an estimate of the estimated VAT/GST &amp; Duty will be levied on the items in your order for shipment to countries outside of the U.S. With your authorization, these funds are used by the carrier or another agent to pay the Import Fees on your behalf (or the recipient's behalf) to the appropriate authorities of the destination country. The payment of import fees is the responsibility of the importer and is levied based on the laws of the country into which the products are being shipped."" on the same page it also says ""You won't be charged additional fees if the actual Import Fees exceed the VAT/GST &amp; Duty we estimated."" and Turkey is listed as one of the eligible countries, yet, they are refusing to cover the fee on my behalf. 

I know some of my options here:

* I can pay the customs fee again get the items then keep chasing after the money I paid for tax &amp;/or duty using chat with us or charge back through bank; i can consider doing this because I have ordered some other parts from other places which I have received already, If I can't receive my order from newegg, I'm gonna have to return them too. But If I do this and the items I receive require some RMA than I will get screwed.

* I can forget about the items,  go for a full charge back through bank since newegg failed to deliver my items as they have promised me; the catch here is items are stuck at customs and they may claim they have done their part, and I can't even send the items back to them because FedEx Turkiye asking me more than 200$ to return the shipper. At that point paying the customs fee makes more sense.

Do I have any other options beside these and how should I proceed?


Back story; 

At 07/03/2017 my package arrived at Turkey and delayed at customs and i have been reaching out to them through ""Chat With Us"" since. At my first contact with 2278378 chat session number, I have been told that I don't have to pay any fees by rep Cassie L. Later I got an e-mail from a customs broker regarding the necessary paperwork for customs and the amount of fees levied on my items. I have provided the paperwork and contacted newegg about the fees in chat session 2284660. Rep Joanne Z. asked me to forward the e-mail I got from the broker, which I did, and told me their shipping team will check it out.

After 24 hours from my last contact with them, my package was still delayed at customs so I contacted them to ask why is this taking this long, this was suppose to be an express shipping after all, I knew customs delays are not their fault but they were doing nothing to speed things up and I didn't wanna wait weekend out. 

At chat session 2287615 things got a complete turn and I have been told by rep Nick W. that they will not cover my custom fees. I refused to pay that I have already paid and told him I will file a charge back through my bank because they have failed to deliver my items as they promised. Nick W. said a charge back will only cause more issues which I felt like a threat. 

I ended that chat session but shortly after decided to give it another try by asking them to charge me back the amount as I paid to them to cover the customs duties, import and sales taxes on my behalf in chat session 2287646. Rep Olivia F. asked me to contact with FedEx(since they are the carrier company), I refused to do that by saying newegg is the one who has a deal with FedEx, they are the FedEx's customer not me but tried it anyway, fedex.com told me to contact FedEx Turkey, but FedEx Turkey never answered my e-mails. 

In that chat session (2287646) Olivia F. also said that ""The tax amount shown during checkout is an estimate. If it is not enough, you need to pay for the left"" which is the exact opposite of what their webpage says. When I reminded her what it says on their website she also said ""It(custom fee) will not be charged by us, but we cannot guarantee the shipping carrier will charge the tax or not."" Again i'm not the customer of FedEx, they cannot charge me and I haven't been inform about this.

*reason for including chat session numbers and dates is I'm gonna cross post this to /r/newegg*",0
"[US] Do I need a lawyer? Accused of cheating by university, and they're threatening expulsion.. [Original Thread Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/6l543s/im_being_accused_of_academic_dishonesty_violation/). 

In two weeks I'll have a hearing scheduled to determine whether I cheated on 2 final exams. These are being held as 2 separate cases, so if I am found guilty of both, the university has the right to expel me. I studied for these exams without the aid of others.

**Relevant details:**

* On first final exam: I got 11/80 questions wrong. Three other people had the same 11/80 wrong and put the same thing for their wrong answers. I'm wondering if they sat behind me and were able to see my answers? Apparently another, who took the exam early, had similar answers but not exact. There is no allegations of a ""leaked"" answer key, only a similar pattern of answers between students. Still, the accusers assume that the exam was leaked during this final as well, due to the similarity of answers between students and the student(s) who took the exam early.

* On second final exam: 5 of my answers were wrong and match up with an alleged ""leaked"" answer key. These are the only 5 questions I got wrong on the whole exam, and I put what I thought was the best answer at the time. The department has a copy of my final exam, which clearly shows my work on most questions, and my reasoning (process of elimination, marking off certain answers in order to narrow down choices to the correct answer). I also did 8-10% better on the final exam than the others being accused of cheating.

The accusers thinks that in both cases, answers to the exams were leaked by student(s) who took the exam early because a number of students had similar answer patterns on both finals. The board has narrowed it down to students they think committed cheating on both exams, by looking at patterns of answers on both exams, and I was grouped in with the alleged cheaters. 

The first thing I did was email my lab professor, who I had for both of these classes in which I was accused. She works DIRECTLY with the people accusing me, and is a full-time Ph.D instructor of both of the classes. So she seemed like the best person I could go to. I asked her to write me an email vouching for my integrity as a student, and this is what she said:

&gt; What is baffling is why this issue is being brought out now long after your semester is over.

&gt; I think that my comments about your integrity would be of more help if it is written to the board/committee instead of directly to you. Wouldn't this make more sense? I think that would surely help your case. I can definitely do this part because when it is called for because I have known you for two semesters ([Class 1] and [Class 2]) and you were indeed one of the best students of the class. I am confident about your integrity. I am surprised a sincere student as you has to face this unfortunate situation. Could it be that this has occurred due to some miscommunication or rather due to some strange coincidence?

&gt; Either way, I am sure you would be able to convincingly explain to the committee to absolve yourself. I can do my part at that stage if it is required. So, keep me updated of the developments if my support/help is needed.

&gt; I am positive that you would get over this issue unscathed.

I immediately printed this email out and gave it to the person advising my case. She looked impressed that I was able to get a letter from someone who instructed me in both of the classes in which I was accused of cheating, so I hope that's a good sign.

Looking through the documents, it appears that the professor, after discovering potential cheating, originally considered voiding the final and basing the students grades on lab performance. Ultimately this was not done. But If that were the case, I would have received very good grades, as my lab grades were excellent. Should I bring this up to the board?

Also, I looked at the stats for the 5 questions I got wrong that matched the alleged ""leaked"" answer key and at least 45 other students had the same wrong answer as I did.
Another thing that baffles me is that if student(s) did take the exam early, surely they were being supervised?

I have 200 credits and am on the cusp of 2 degrees, and have attended this university for 6 years. Now this situation happens to me, a month before I graduate. I cannot afford to re-take classes, and I certainly cannot afford to pay back my loans if I am falsely accused of cheating.

The frustrating part is that final decisions are made by a board of students. This seems unfair, as students probably tend to side with professors (the accusers), not the students (accused).

I cannot sleep at night thinking about this. I don't even know how to write an opening or closing statement. Any advice on what I can do to resolve this situation would make a world of difference.

"Tenet going to sue for property damages (x-post from /r/landlord). So this is going to be a long story, but I’ll make sure to add a TL;DR. I’m going to start in the beginning. 
My parents bought a foreclosed house in what-I-though was a very nice, quaint, small Indiana town (however in the past 6 months, my perspective of the town has completely changed). It was a fixer-upper and once it was nice and livable they stayed there for a year, then decided to move back to their primary home and rent out the newly renovated home. First few tenets were all right, paid rent on time and kept a good line of communication with my parents-at least my dad who was the man in charge of getting the rent and writing out receipts. When our old tenets left because the couple were having marital issues, they broke the contract and gave us the keys to the house. No biggie (at this time, my dad did not do a formal lease including a leasing contract-my parents are traditional salt-of-the-earth immigrants from Mexico that attained citizenship in the 90s). 
However, after my dad inspected the home after the couple left, he noticed they left in a bad shape. The neighbor-next-door love my dad and the elderly neighbor told my dad that her son is looking for a place and thought it would be nice to have him next door to her. My dad thought it would be a nice idea and knew the son to be a handy-man (later I would know for this to be complete BS) and trusted the son to fix up any repairs from the last tenet and my dad would lower the rent about 50 dollars. Deal was made, and the son moved in and got started on repairs around the house, such as holes in walls, holes in doors, broken window screen-minimal stuff. 
The first month, we did not pay and took out what he spent on materials and didn’t pay rent. The wife was working at factory in-town and the man was stay-at-home working on things. Months passed and we didn’t get rent, as the wife was fired for starting a fight at work and couldn’t get ends met. We were lenient and told them to pay us as soon as they could. The tenet wanted then a formal lease contract so he could get a lawyer that was in charge of a trust fund to pay the rent due. The trust fund lawyer never got a hold of us, and the following month the tenet was arrested for paraphernalia of crystal meth. The following month, the wife of the tenet was also arrested for the same charges and by the start of this year-my parents were stuck with an abandoned property and rent due. Months past and no communication between the arrested tenets, while I reached out to tenets’ family members to get a response from them as to what to do with their personal belongings. No one was available or disposed to help the tenets. My dad decided to go to court and legally evict them and have a judge figure out what to do with their personal belongings. The initial court hearing ruled that the wife-who was out of jail sooner than the other tenet- were to go to the property and put things into a storage unit, so the house could be cleared out.  
	Also, to give a glimpse of the amount of crap they had I’ll give you a mental image of a Goodwill store vomiting into a second-story home. Nascar posters and a large waterbed decorated the house-things were trash. Nothing of value was found at the house. 
	The wife came and took things to the storage and my dad with his helpers made trips to her storage and fill it up with remaining things they had at the house. Once the storage was full, my dad moved things to a tool shed we have behind the house, but larger things such as furniture was left on the front porch-which we later got cited by the city. Everything was tossed and my dad had a city garbage truck takes loads of things away. 
	A second court hearing was held earlier today, so my dad could get something figured out with the rent that was past due. They came into a payment agreement, however at the hearing the former tenet had a list of two pages of things that were missing and wants to claim property damage. 

My questions are for my dad, do the tenets have a viable case against my dad for a property damage claim? If the property was abandoned and no communication was made with the landlord to remove the items and the storage was full, could the landlord be held responsible with the property hold it as private property? 

The current situation of the rental property stands as everything is cleared out, my dad is working on repairs and hoping to continue to rent the house out or is thinking about having a property management take care of the house. 

**TL;DR** Dad owns a rental property in small-town, USA. Dad leases it to dead-beat son of our next-door-neighbor. Fail to make rent. Tenets get arrested, leave rental property and their personal property abandoned.  Court decides to have them move things to storage unit, things get thrown out because unit gets too full. Now tenet wants to throw a claim for property damages.",1
"Help please! - Small business having year long billing issue with major Shipping Corporation. I'm looking for any legal advice on an issue concerning my small business (Washington State, USA).  I've been going back and forth with a shipping company for nearly a year, and I'm at my wit's end.  I'll call the shipping company ""Z"" for the sake of this post.  

Thanks in advance to the kind souls that read this whole thing and reply.  (This is also my first time in Reddit.  So let me know if I chose the wrong subreddit, and I can try to switch it to a different one.)

My questions are:  Do I have any legal footing on this issue?  I believe I'm in the right with significant evidence against ""Z"".  Do you agree, or have I missed something?  

Here is the summary.  This shipment arrived August 2016:
--I arranged a Freight shipment from Turkey with Z Freight service.  I arranged for Z Freight to pick up this shipment from my vendor.
--Due to miscommunication between myself and my vendor, my vendor arranged the shipment himself which went via Z Small Package service (much more expensive than Z Freight service) .
--He gave Z my Freight number for the shipment - a 9 digit number.
--Z had to have shortened the 9 digit Freight account number that my vendor gave to 6 digits (Small Package accounts are 6 digits).  It had to be 6 digits to bill Small Package/send Small Package.
--This resulted in Z billing a third party for the shipment (that cooresponded the truncated account number).
--The bill is roughly 4 times what I was originally quoted (I was quoted based on the shipment going through Freight).
--That 3rd party business obviously refused the bill.
--Z then changed the bill to the shipper (my vendor) instead of the receiver (me) after I refused to pay the full amount (which I refused based on the fact that no questions were raised, and they had to have manually/intentionally shortened the account number to push it through).  I was not ok with Z billing my vendor, and emailed Z about it.  I also called my Z rep's manager twice, left voicemails, no call back. 
--When Z decided to bill my vendor, Z said they're doing so because it's my vendors fault for not listening to me and shipping Small Package.  They also said they were billing my vendor because they had verbally told me they wouldn't charge me the full Small Package bill amount when this whole thing occured (my rep had previously acknowledged over the phone that ultimately Z was at fault).
--My incoterms that I have on record with Z for that shipment clearly laid out that the receiver should be billed, but Z billed a 3rd party.  Then they billed my vendor (shipper).  
--Z should never have billed a 3rd party for the shipment initially - especially since it was not enabled on my account and nothing matched with my business (including zip code).  The 3rd party they billed is an entirely different business.  Nothing in common with mine.
--No one from Z checked with me before it was billed, and my vendor had noted on the slip that the receiver should be billed, not 3rd party or sender. (I have the actual image of the slip from my vendor).  
--I tried to fight this with Z; but when they billed my vendor, I had exhausted everything I could do.  So I sent my vendor all of the information I had, and I told him he needed to fight this with Turkish Z and not to pay.  The goal was that he would refuse to pay and present the facts, and Z would adjust and bill me for the amount I was originally quoted which I would then pay.
--To be honest, I'm not sure what my vendor had done on his end.  But he reached out to me about a week ago and said Z is going to take legal action against him if he doesn't pay the full amount billed to him (the 4x amount) in the next few days.
--Because I don't think this is right or legally justified, I reiterated all of my points to US Z and Turkish Z in an email last week hoping to finally get this resolved.  But I have had absolute silence from them for the past roughly 4 days.  
--I'm about to follow up; but I'm trying to figure out what other leverage I have.

On top of all of this, we've recently made the difficult decision to close our business.  We are planning to be totally buttoned up by the end of year.  Regardless, I've been dealing with this off and on for almost a year now.  

I'm angered that they are going after my vendor who is a one-man artisanal business.  They have previously told me they can't change it because it went through Small Package, but my main argument is that it never should have for the very simple reason that they truncated my account number to make it work.  I also have an incredibly difficult time believing that they can't somehow adjust the bill.

(The only other thing that may have happened is if my vendor told them to shorten the account number (and he hasn't admitted that).  But that still doesn't resolve the issue of billing a 3rd party without my approval.)

Thanks again for reading this and giving some thought to my dilemma!",0
"Offered a promotion, but it's less than what others make. (Corporate casino, non-union) help?. Hi Reddit. This is my first time posting on here, and any help would be much appreciated! I apologize for the sloppiness of the format, I'm typing this on my phone at work. 



I'm 26, Caucasian, female, and I work in the slot department on grave yard in a [non-union] casino. I've been in this department for 2 years, and the casino as a whole for almost 7 years. I recently, after much prodding and being insistent on other managers, have been offered a dual rate ""promotion.""  By becoming a dual rate, im basically a mini supervisor. My current rate is $10.90 an hour. The promotion is $1. But it doesn't entirely bump my pay up. Days that I supervisors all day (which would possibility be once every two weeks) I would make $11.90/hour for 8 hours. Days that I don't supervise the entire day, I would get paid $11.90 for 2 hours. 

The major problem is that the manager who had the final say in promoting me told me I would be getting $2 more. All of the other dual rates make $2 more per hour. So essentially $16 more when they supervise all day, and $4 a day when they don't. Said manager (I think his official title is assistant casino operations manager, or some other fancy mumbo jumbo,) played a ton of games when it came time to offering me this promotion because he didn't want to do it since it takes away from his bonus. For example, he told another manager to tell me it was okay to promote me, even though HE was the one who had the final say so. He also took his sweet time going to HR to get the paperwork going.  This manager is also trying to cut expenses in any way possible so he gets a bigger bonus. Gotta love corporate. 

The two dual rates on my shift make $2 more for supervising. Technically for them it's only $1.85 more because they got a $0.15 raise about a year or so ago. I am the lowest paid person on my shift. Everyone is at $15 an hour or more. Part of the reason is that they have been here since day one and were on a different pay scale. (Different ownership, Michael Gaughan at first and then Boyd gaming.). I understand being considerably newer, I won't be making as much as somebody since day one. My raises are $0.20 a year. That is part of the reason I wanted to become a dual rate at that $2 mark. I would basically be getting a $0.50 cent raise. My biggest gripe is that other dual rates make $2 more, why are they trying to get me to take $1?  Even newer dual rates got it at $2 an hour.

One of the managers on my shift says he personally thinks they're trying to get one over on me and suggested I sit down and talk with the director and assistant manager. After doing some thinking and talking to my best friend, I don't think meeting with them is a bad idea and inquiring about why my pay is considerably lower, especially given the fact the assistant manager TOLD ME $2 more.  I don't have any concrete proof that he told me, so it's my word versus his. I figured having the director and assistant manager in there wouldn't be a bad idea because that way it won't turn into a big game of he said she said. 

I figured with the meeting, I would thank them for giving me this opportunity to further my career, but I was under the impression the promotion would be more. I know I can't be aggressive, but I can't be passive either. It's easier said than done. I don't know if they're going to care it'll literally take 20 years to get to where everybody else is at. Depending on where this meeting goes will determine what the next step is. Part of me is nervous that they'll take away my promotion for questioning them... then it opens up a discriminatory / retaliation case.  But I don't feel right taking the promotion knowing it should be more money. 

One of the things I did look up was the NLRA section 7 which basically says employees are allowed to discuss salaries amongst themselves. So during my meeting if they tell me that I'm not allowed to talk about it, I can let them know there's a federal law which protects me, and section 8 of the act basically says they can't retaliate against me for inquiring about other people's pay.

I don't really want to get another job. I live in Las Vegas, and the economy is tough. Not to mention, it took me 2 years to get full time in my department. I don't want to give that up just to have to do it somewhere else and possibility wait longer than that to become full time. I do really like my job for the most part. Working on graveyard is awesome. The people on this shift are cool and want me to better myself. Also, I make tips. A lot of nights were slow, but I make good money for working a shift that isn't too busy. 

The casino I work at is not union, so I'm only protected by federal laws. I would like some thoughts and opinions on the matter. Should I fight it? Should I shut up and take the dollar? Am I being a brat? Are there any other laws that protect me, or let upper management do whatever they want? Do I even stand a chance? 

Thanks!!",0
"I was scammed by a dealership and sold a faulty scooter. What can I do about it? (Decatur, GA, USA). I've been homeless on and off again (since 17, I'm 20 now), and have really been working on getting my life together this year. Since I got a little bit of a savings together, and the job market around me has been awful lately, I decided to spent most of it ($800) on a scooter because a local shop that does deliveries that I used to work at (Jimmy John's) was hiring again. I figured I could make the pay the driver's do, just without having to pay for insurance, as the scooter is a 50cc. 


I looked around and found a dealership selling them unused at low prices. I was ensured a 30-day warranty, and recieved a sheet along with my title after purchase saying as much. However, after using my scooter for a few weeks, it began to have issues starting up, and stalled often. I was still within the warranty, which the owner of the shop said in the case of that sort of thing happening would cover issues.


My boyfriend and I brought the scooter in and the guy who ran the place was extremely short tempered. My boyfriend had also sat up with me and tried Youtube videos that instructed on ways to start it with a kickstart and whatnot (nothing that would void the warranty) and he refused to believe we were having the problems that we were. He even started getting very short and argumentative with me despite me simply asking questions. It got to a point that he refused to answer me when I spoke to him and instead talked to my boyfriend. I am legitimately afraid of what would have happened had he not been there because he was so upset that he had his hands in a shaking fist, as if to stop him from doing something to me. He claimed that he would keep it until the following Tuesday (maybe 5 days from then -- not within the warranty, but his mechanic wasn't in town until then, he said) to ""make me happy"" but that he assured his scooters didn't have issues starting up even though the two of us saw with our own eyes after an hour of attempting to start it that it wouldn't work.


So we get the scooter back on Tuesday and of course after a day of use it's back to the exact same problems. I saw that the company I bought it from had 4 of 5 stars but I hadn't checked what the reviews really said because it seemed legit since there were 33 of them, so I assumed there were more good than bad. One of the reviews mentioned a bout of suspected racism. It's important to note that I am black, and my boyfriend is white. Besides me being a woman and this guy  maybe having some traditional ""talk to the man during a sale, not the woman"" (He'd made crude remarks about my intelligence when we spoke to him before dropping the bike off), some of his rage could be from the fact that I'm black. With all that I know about this situation, I've come up with a plan of sorts, but I'm not 100% sure of the legalities involved. 


I want to start all this by going outside and trying to start it again, but getting it on video and mentioning today's date, what's been wrong with it, etc. I want a few minutes of me starting it up. After that doesn't work, I want to call them and ask for a receipt from them ""fixing"" my bike so it's on record that that happened (They did it for free so they just had us take it back without any proof --
 I know, I didn't think about it until we left). From there, I'll call him (the owner) myself and talk to him about the issues I'm STILL having with the scooter -- I've had my boyfriend call up until this point because I've legitimately been kind of scared of this guy blowing up at me (I have PTSD and a history of abuse) -- but this time, record him mentioning the dates of fixing it, and the fact that we brought it to him, that we were within warranty, etc. What I predict is him to actually speak his mind and blow up at me as well to make my point seem even more valid. From there, two options: 

1.) My SO's mom is a paralegal who has contact with a host of lawyers willing to do immediate pro-bono work. I want to sue in small claims and get my money back. Until then, I'll get my scooter repaired at a local shop and keep the receipts from that. If all of this works out, I'd still like to go through with option two as well, but I'm not sure if the legalities of it:

2.) If she's unable to get someone to help us, then (and I know this seems kind of petty, but I honestly want other people to not buy from these monsters) I would like to have both my boyfriend and I leave a one-star review on their site along with a link to a YouTube video of the footage that I have edited in with an on-screen transcript of our call and the audio from the call. I know that Georgia has a one-party consent law, so I wouldn't need their permission to use the audio, but could I be sued at that point for posting that sort of thing? I'm assuming I'd have to use rhetoric that doesn't necessarily say ""Don't shop here"" but simply state the facts about the situation, facts being that I am having tons of trouble with them and that they are not fixing my bike.",0
"Issue with court ordered out patient alcohol rehab. Please help!. I caught a dui case in January of 2017. I was sentenced to a year probation and was told to get an alcohol assessment and I am required to follow the recommendations from the alcohol assessment. Below is my story.




Jan 26 2017 I had an appointment with a lady named Katie at Dawn Farms  for my alcohol assessment. I was court ordered to have an alcohol assessment. During the assessment, Katie recommended that I do 24 weeks of outpatient group therapy at dawn farms with a lady named Hannah on wednesdays from 2-3:30. Katie was training a young lady and explained the rules and asked if I had any questions regarding the assessment. She asked me to sign a piece of paper confirming everything that we went over and that I was to attend 24 weeks of outpatient meetings as well as attend 2 aa meetings per week.  I attended the 24 weeks with no issue. After the first 12 weeks, I didn't get a review over my performance or acknowledged on how I did. I was just given a piece of paper that I had to write new goals on and that was it. After completing the 24 weeks on July 12th 2017, Hannah mentioned to me that I could either continue to do the Wednesday's 2pm groups or switch to Thursday's.  There was never a discussion I had with anyone from Dawn Farms regarding another 12 weeks. The program has two phases, recovery group support and recovery support. One is 24 weeks and the other is 12. Not everyone does 36 weeks, or 24 weeks. Some people do 12 weeks but everyone signs the same form that states that in order to complete the Dawn farms program, you have to do 36 weeks. There are check marks next to both phases that you are recommended to do. My contract had the recovery support phase checked off and had it wrote by Katie in pen ""2 sets of 12=24 weeks"". I was not court ordered to complete the program, I was court ordered to get an assessment and to attend the recommended meetings that were given to me during the assessment. Every individual is different went it comes to the assessment. Katie might recommend something completely different than what another person might recommend, but she did my intake and no one else did. And since everyone is different, she assessed me based on the information I provided her and made the decision to give me 24 weeks of outpatient therapy. And That was her job but she no longer works there.

On July 14th I went to dawn farms at about 3:10 to speak with someone who could help me better understand why the piece of paper says something different than what was said to me from Hannah. A lady gave me a card and told me to speak to ray, who is the coordinator of the program.

I got ahold of ray at about 5pm and spoke with him about the issue. I explained to him the piece of paper and he said Katie may have screwed up with my intake. I told him that was not my fault, but we can't talk to her anyways because she no longer works there. Did she really screw up? These are done on an individual basis. He said that things may have changed from when I originally signed the paper in January. I told him that if that was the case then I was to sign a new form.  He told me that he wants to talk to his staff about this to make sure there are no loop holes like this again. This is not considered a loophole if this is something that they recommend to other people in treatment. This does not seem fair. Everyone who signs the same form would have to do 36 weeks. I was planning on signing up for classes at washtenaw community college. How am I suppose to plan things out for myself if there is a lack of communication and a lack of review after the 12 week period? He said that he would not write a letter saying that I completed the 36 weeks at dawn farms. I never asked him to write a letter to be dishonest and say that i did something I didn't do. I told him I want him to write a letter stating that I completed my 24 week recovery support group at dawn farm. I told him I would pick it up next week. My probation officer told me that I need to do whatever they tell me to do basically... but I did! I did the 24 weeks with no issue and out of no where they are telling me I need to do 12 more! Am I wrong for trying to fight this?



In terms of the dawn farms client handbook, it states that the staff will not lie to you or emotionally or physically abuse you. I feel like I was lied to and it's emotionally hurtful to know that I was mislead and it's causing me anxiety. I should feel good about being sober, not bad. I haven't had any screw ups since I've been at Dawn Farms. 



Dawn farms website states ""Group therapy – Several group therapy options are offered that are designed to help clients with varying needs, levels of motivation and intensity of substance use problems. Groups range in duration from 8 to 24 weeks depending upon client needs and preference.""



If I signed a contract for leasing a vehicle for 24 months. That's what I would expect. I wouldn't expect the dealer to call me at the 24 month period to tell me that things changed and that it was actually a 36 month lease without me being aware.",0
"I want to sue the psych department at a hospital for malpractice. Hello, my name is Amelia and I was hospitalized after a suicide attempt more than two years ago. I live in the twin cities metropolitan area of Minnesota. I won't specifically state what hospital because I don't want to give myself away, but I can tell you that it was supposed to be a good one.

 As part of the treatment there I had a team of psychiatrists including a psychiatry resident who was the main doctor that talked to me. The head psychiatrist, who was also the head of the psychiatry residency program was a bitch to say the least. She was rude and she never talked directly to me. She talked to me in the third person. ""Well, if Amelia is good, we'll let her participate in the activity today."" ""If Amelia can keep herself safe she can go to pet therapy tomorrow."" Her terrible attitude wasn't the worst of it, however I believe that she was the one responsible for what everyone did. It all came down to her. 

I was deemed suicidal by the on-call resident one night because I was displaying unsafe behaviors, and he ordered me to seclusion for the entire night. He said if I didn't go willingly I would be forced in. Confused and upset, I went into that room (because i willingly went they didn't lock it), and only a minute later, my nurse at the time, Chris (he was an asshole, didn't even treat me like a human being) was talking with that resident and some other nurses about moving all of my personal belongings to a different room that had a camera. Confused, I offered to help and opened the door. A couple nurses shoved me back into the corner and ordered that my shoes and jacket were taken off. They ripped that off and left me in the room crying with the door locked. 

When I get stressed, I have problems urinating. And they did let me use the bathroom about an hour after they locked the door, but they would stare at me the whole time. And each time I couldn't void. Chris thought I was just doing this to be oppositional (I was misdiagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder) and he told me he wouldn't let me go to the bathroom anymore. The door to leave seclusion was unlocked at the time (the bathroom door always locked) but if I even touched the door they told me they'd lock it again. I was crying because I was in so much pain because I couldn't urinate, but they brushed it off because I was diagnosed with ODD, I was just being oppositional. Luckily, Chris eventually went on break, and this one aide, bless her heart, let me go to the bathroom after she gave me a lot of water, and I finally went. I think she was the only one that believed me. 

Well, that wasn't even the worst of it. They made me spend the whole night in the seclusion room with the light on, no blanket and just a mattress and my pillow. The room was dirty. They never cleaned it. I could see peeled off fingernails in the corner from the last person in there (or maybe a few people before) and I told them but no one would clean it up for me. It was just me and the fingernails for the entire night. I never got to shower, wash my face, or even brush my teeth the previous night. I asked but they said no. I couldn't even brush my hair. And the worst part is, none of this was in my medical record. They didn't write that I spent the night there. They kept it vague, saying the plan was that I sit there for a few minutes. 

and that's not even the worst. Because the next night I had the same nurse, Chris again. And he wanted me to sit on my bed around bed time, and when i woukdn't he threatened to send me to seclusion. I told he couldn't do that, that it's not right, but he did it anyway. When I refused to go, he ordered a couple nurses to come in while he carried my mattress to that room again. When the nurses couldn't get me to go willingly (""Come on Amelia, be a big girl and take my hand!"" mind you i was sixteen at the time) Chris and another guy named Eric came back. Then one of them suggested that instead of calling security they would just carry me there. So you know what they did? They grabbed my my arms and legs and carried me like I was an animal. I was struggling, trying to break free, and my pants were falling down because they were too big, but they kept bringing me down the hall. And they brought me into that room and dropped me on the mattress, walked out, and locked the door. And I spent my second night in a row in that room. That incident was never recorded in my record. 

There's even more littler things, but that's the major stuff. I still suffer with flashbacks and nightmares among other things today. And I'm not necessarily looking for money, I just want those who were involved to pay for this. I want this on their record, so hopefully this doesn't happen to someone else. I want to feel okay again. So all I need to know, is do I have a chance to win this lawsuit? If I do, how do I go about it? Where do I start? I'm not super hopeful because it's a psych case, but I feel like I have to do something. 
Thank you.
TL;DR I was treated poorly by numerous psychiatric staff during a hospitalization and I was traumatized from it.",0
"question regarding utilities in a roommate situation. for legal reference, I live in Alaska

TL;DR my roomate is shit and I have shut off most of the breakers at the panel because he won't help pay the electric bill, which he has more than doubled in the time he's lived here.  can he get me arrested for that?

I have one of the worst roommates in the world (I'm working on getting rid of him)... and I'm getting really sick of him... I could write a book on the reasons why... but it really boils down to he is considered disabled, he flashes that victim card every chance he can, and uses it as a crutch.  

Anyway, to the point.  he has lived with me for almost 7 years now I think... he is (currently) married and his wife lived here too, but she went to her home country because her mother was sick, and now she doesn't want to come back here and put up with him.  she plans to divorce him.  she also went back just to visit last year before her mother got sick, so she has been gone more often than here.  whenever she is gone, he stops cleaning up after himself at all... so, while she is around, he is not as bad, but he is abusive and that's why she isn't coming back.  she has been gone most of the last year, and so things have been getting bad.  to the point I have stopped using the kitchen entirely because it's too disgusting to use, and I bought a microwave, minifridge and induction burner to use in my room so I can occasionally cook stuff.  the burner tends to blow the breaker though so I don't use it too often.  but I digress again...

so... in all the time they have lived with me they have never helped with the electric bill.  She didn't really do much that used electricity, and initially he didn't either... so no big deal.  roughly a year ago though, my bill jumped from $60-$80ish to $200ish regularly.  last month was slightly under $250.  this was mainly due to him starting to grow his own weed (it's legal here and he mostly stayed within the allowed legal limits).  I do not smoke it or have any interest in it myself so this was not something I was part of.  so I asked him to contribute to the power bill and he said he can't afford it.  I've mentioned it to him occasionally since then and always get the same response.  when his wife went back for her visit last year, she gave him $3000 for his bills... he didn't pay a single bill... instead, he bought her something worth a few hundred dollars, and then bought a $2000 sex doll... he dresses it like Nelliel from Bleach... complete with hollow mask and a sword.

so... his wife for some reason didn't walk out the door when she saw that... but she mentioned to me that he wasted a bunch of money she gave him, and she wouldn't tell me what he bought, but told me to look in the room some time when he isn't around.  

so... that's been grating on my nerves a long time, and that's just one of the worst examples, but hardly the only example.  we built our own 3rd bedroom in our living room so that each of us has our own space and the wife made that room hers.  last week I noticed the light was on and I looked inside to find out why, and I notice his computer sitting on the floor... just the main case.  I knew he had been using a computer earlier that day because I heard him typing in his room... he wasn't there so I went and took a look, and as I suspected... brand new alienware computer!  Also, he has a portable radiator style electric heater in there that was running full blast and making the room 90 degrees.  and this just a week or 2 after I paid the highest electric bill I've ever had.  

so he and I had it out earlier and I shut off most of the breakers and told him not to touch the breaker panel because it's my electricity and I'm done letting him freeload. as usual he made lots of threats, like ""better make sure your bedroom door is locked tonight"" and then he threatened to call the police on me (which is really ironic seeing as how he has a really low opinion of any authority figure, especially police).  so... as far as the lease agreement, it's month to month, and technically I am the renter and subletting according to the landlord.  the landlord has actually never made me sign a lease agreement though... different issues entirely but I could write a post just as long about him.  he did once have me sign a fake agreement that said I was paying more rent than I was at the time, because he was getting the building appraised and wanted to increase the value.  I am 99% sure, knowing him as I do, that he has long since lost that fake one.  however at one point, in order to help my roomates, he signed a fake agreement with them so that they could use it as proof of residence.  he probably wouldn't even be able to find that one either if pressed though.  the utility bill is in my name only.  

so... could I actually get in trouble for this?  

the heat is not electric (and it's warm enough this time of year, we don't need it anyway), and I've made sure the fridge still has power, but because I know how he is, I will probably have to turn off the main breaker to the apartment when I leave to work tomorrow or else he will just flip them on until I get home.",1
"Legal issues with online website designers stating that I can't get a refund of £1,500 on a service, even though they have not provided any service and are asking for an additional £3,000 as I agreed to pay in 3 equal installments.. I'm 21 years old and I'm in the process of starting up a online retail company. 
After searching online I found a website design and hosting company. Requested a call and the sales person I spoke to gave a good sales pitch and I was eager to go ahead. 
I described the website I wanted at length and he said that this would not be an issue and stated that £4,500 would be sufficient and this is their 'silver design package'. After some deliberating and further discussion with him I went ahead and paid for the first of three installments. They sent me a design brief to fill in for them to be able to start designing the website. NOTE: I did not fill in this design brief, so no designs will have been carried out and nothing has been done by them apart from set up an account for me on their site. 
I was struggling with the terminology of the form as relatively new to website design so called their support desk, and at first had to wait 7 days to talk to some. When they got around to phoning me there were several language barriers as English was not their first language. So I went away from, losing some confidence in the overall process. 
I was then contacted by the salesman saying that after a further review of my website functionalities the design cost would actually be around £10,000. 
Basically to summarise, I dealt with their technical team a few more times and each time left me feeling less and less confident in their abilities so I sent an email to the original salesman asking for a refund, but hinting that I would be back, but that I need the money for another venture and that the website would have to take a back seat, but when I did come back I would upgrade the package. Hoping that this would act as an incentive for them to refund me. 
I received a reply stating that after speaking to the managers they would like me to comply with the terms and conditions and pay the additional £3,000. So initially this completely took me off guard, as I did tick the terms and conditions and I thought I would have to pay. After rereading the t&amp;cs, nowhere does it state that the full sum must be paid, only that if it is not paid, they are allowed to freeze the service. Also that no refund of the initial installment for the service will be given. They are also under french jurisdiction as I later found out. So after some research this is what I replied with:

Hi Zak,

I understand where you are coming from, but I would argue that the terms and conditions are void, based on the fact that in our correspondence prior to payment we discussed the entire website including the affiliate section and you proposed the silver design package, stating it would be sufficient. If there were concerns regarding the complexity of the website, these could have been expanded on before the finalised quote.

Regarding the actual design of the website and use of £1,500, no actual work has carried out as I have not submit the design brief. I appreciate that you may deduct some expenses from the £1,500 to cover your time, but aside from that very little has happened.

It would not be unreasonable for me to state that the item I purchased is not up to the ‘expected standard’ and therefore a refund within a 2-year period is required from French Consumer Legal Guarantees. From what I've stated above and based on the following:

The technical support team took 10 working days to transfer my domain to GODADDY. I raised 5 separate tickets asking them for an update on the process, with only 1 receiving a response. The ticket was eventually closed when they gave me the login to GANDI. Stating that I would have to carry out the domain transfer myself, but on your website it states that a domain transfer should take 72 hours.

The original support ticket did not request a domain transfer as I asked how it's possible to get a refund on a domain name. This was not answered and they instead sent me a link for a domain transfer. I know that for a ‘.co.uk’ site all that is required is the IPS tag change, so for it to take 10 working days for them to respond is completely unreasonable and leaves me with little faith in their response time.

I also experienced great difficulty in conveying my website idea to the designer I spoke with, albeit partly down to language barriers. It was my understanding that the website design had been fully understood before making payment, but your designer had very little knowledge of it.

I hope we can resolve this mater in a way that leaves us both satisfied. 


I'm still waiting a response, but if anyone has any advice on how I should proceed with this and if I have any legal ground to stand on in court that would be much appreciated.
Just as a young man looking to start up a business, I feel like they were almost trying a scare tactic just to get me to pay straight away and as they havent actually provided me a service, and there has only been 6 emails back and forth between us, it just feels like sharp practice.",0
"Neighbors [mid 50s-ish] purposefully annoying me [m27] and my wife [f25] with loud music and overheard veiled threats toward us (Ontario, Canada). Note: Posted in r/relationships and r/askto first, someone suggested you'd be a better resource. 

Hey Reddit,

I live in a condo in a town about 45 min north of Toronto, Canada. My neighbors (we share one of those metal walls on our balcony, so sound basically is like it's right beside each other) they were blasting music from about 3pm to 11:07pm on Sunday night, specifically to affect us. I found out from their drunk rants back and forth that they are upset that I sometimes play metal music after work (I've never got a complaint from them before). I'll play music sometimes off my cell phone or off my TV, but they had a very loud sound system blasting oldies rock (van halen, AC/DC, etc) all day, while making jokes like ""hey Rocco think we should play some screamo music instead?"" He'd say ""nah I hate that shit, this is real music"". It's a man and woman, probably at least late 50s, my wife and I are mid 20's. (and Disturbed/System of a Down/ Otep is the music I think they're complaining about, certainly not screamo!) 

Eventually we complained to security twice, they only answered the door to security for the first complaint, which I made on my way out of the building for a rec league sport I play downtown. My wife ended up feeling unsafe as she heard them after the complaint ""they don't know who they just fucked with, they'll regret this"", ""I'll fuck them up every chance I get"", ""we'll complain to security about every little thing they do now"", etc - those were all told to the security guard and added to their file (whatever that entails). 

While I was out my wife went down to complain the second time, the male neighbor walked out of the parking garage, visibly intoxicated, was most likely driving just before that. He saw my wife making the complaint, both her and the security guard noticed that he almost fell over he was so drunk. I probably would have called the cops right then if I had seen that but neither of them did, pretty sure it's too late now. 

According to my wife they then made more veiled threats to us talking with each other, my wife got scared and called me and I left my game early to come home. Neighbors continued drinking and playing music until 11:07pm, their son came out at around 10:30 and told them they should be careful because 11pm (official noise complaint time) was coming up, they just laughed at him (I'm guessing he's around 15ish, and I hear him smoking bongs on the balcony pretty often). He came out at another point and asked if they had any batteries and they just laughed at him and said ""what do you think we are, the dollar store?"" - obviously they're not the best parents and really drunk. 

I took recordings with my phone of the loud music and backed them all up on iCloud. Even in the bathroom on the opposite side of the unit (950 sq ft), with my cellphone music at full blast and the fan on I could hear deep bass. Security entered our unit both times (at my wife's request) and noted the loud volume we could hear inside.

These neighbors are in at least their late 50s, maybe older. They don't seem to work at all, sound like they're straight out of Sunnyvale trailer park and best friends with Jim Lahey, they really just drink and smoke cigarettes all day. They and I smoke cigarettes so we're outside often at the same times (I've never talked to them before, I don't even know what they look like, but wife does). They rent, we own. Security guard told my wife that they and their landlord will be sent a complaint letter. 

I'm worried that they'll cause more problems in the future, especially if I have music on that they can hear, it's the summer and I like to have the windows open and some music on for like half an hour when I get home from work most days, but I don't even own a stereo that could play music at even half the volume they had theirs on at today. I'll likely stop that or at least cut this back now. 

Any suggestions? I'll call the cops if I need to (if this persists) but I really don't want to cause even more issues, these people sound like really vengeful children. I found the website for Toronto bylaw and it says noises at anytime, not just after 11pm that effect ""quiet enjoyment of a home"" can be grounds for a cop call, but 
a) we're in a nearby town and I'm not sure if the bylaw is the same (couldn't find that online) and 
b) we like to make noise too, we have the occasional party or times with loud music (but not as loud) - difference is if we get a complaint we've turned it down and apologized, not turn it up and make threats and loudly complain all day (only got one noise complaint in this building from a different neighbor and did exactly that, but have got some at past residences and did the same)

Any ideas Reddit? 

Tl;dr - condo neighbors (who share balcony with metal wall between) wanted to get back at me for listening to normal-Volume music by blasting really loud oldies rock from 3pm to just after 11pm while drinking, we could overhear them making non-specific threats against us, wife got really scared. One of them likely drove really drunk during the day, but no proof of that.",1
"(US, Connecticut) Brothers girlfriend disappeared with their son and can't seem to get any help with authorities. Ok so somewhat of a long story so bear with me!
My younger brother has been dating this girl for a couple years and they have a 16mo old son together. They currently were living with our mother to save up some money. Normally they text all day while he's at work and one day he noticed she wasn't responding or answering any calls so he panicked and went home to check on her (she's a school bus driver and currently isn't working) and when he got home all of her and their stuff was gone and her phone was wiped clean and left on the counter. No note, nothing else left behind. Immediately he panics because his child and the person who he thought was the love of his life had vanished with no idea where or why they were gone. I advised him to go to the police (obviously) to which he had been sent back and fourth from CT police to Massachusetts police because they live in MA. Although their licenses say CT (a bit of a confusing mess because the baby technically lives in mass)
So both PD'd basically tell him because they were never married that it's a civil matter and needs to file for a court date. He also decides to report her vehicle that she has stolen because it is legally his, registered and insured in only his name, or so he thought. CT police determine that its registered to her now, which means she forged his signature on the title and registered it in her name. After learning that he decides to file criminal charges for forgery, so an officer begins to help him with that. He also calls dcf to try and see if they will help to find out that she has claimed that he's is abusive, which is a lie, she has already admitted to falsely claiming abuse from him once before. She was arrested back in February for hitting him with a car, to which he felt bad and decided to drop the charges and take her back. He attempts to go to MA court and they tell him because they have licenses in CT that he needs to file there, and dcf had been in contact with her but cannot tell him where she is. He believes she might have gone to Virginia to be with a guy she cheated on him with once before. He decides to go through her phone she left and managed to find a way to contact her and they started talking through messenger in instagram. This whole time before that he's attempting to contact people who he knows would be in contact with her to relay messages that she's going to have felony charges in the hopes of her just deciding to return. It sort of works because he ends up getting a call from her saying basically, how can we make these charges go away, so he tries to say, bring my son to my house tonight and I'll call the officer and see if we can get the forgery charges stopped (he called the officer after to tell him she said she'd bring him home and told the officer to move forward with the charges still). So later he tried to contact her again to find out she blocked him again and changed her number, so it was all a ploy to get him to drop the charges. The CT officer advises him to apply for emergency custody at the court so that way the police can get involved with finding his son and maybe even put out an amber alert.  He goes and applies and is denied the emergency custody and receives a court date (August 10th) and here comes the next problem. He has to have her served, he needs to know where she lives to have her served. The dcf officer knows where she is but cannot legally tell him. The police tell him if he calls the marshals that they can get in contact with dcf to determine where she is to have her served. He contacts the marshals but they say that they cannot do that and he needs to give them an address. Today he receives a call from the police department that she had returned and dropped the vehicle off at the station and took off (she parked it and then called the station later to tell them it was there) so we know at least as of the last 12 hours she's back in the state, he calls the dcf officer and she was not aware she was back and tried calling her but the number was changed. The last time she spoke with her they video chatted and she claimed she saw the baby and he appeared to be ok, but she hadn't heard she was coming back and can't get ahold of her. 
Today he called a lawyer and she claimed that if he can't get her served they'll just drop the case and he will have to re file, but that will be futile unless he can get her served, so basically she can just disappear with their child and there's nothing he can do about it because even with the warrant for the forgery he can't do anything, the officers told him it wasn't a charge thy would go over state lines for. He can't even manage to hire a lawyer because it's just too expensive. He's feeling a bit deflated and beaten down because he keeps basically not getting any help at every turn. All he wants is his son back. We are all so worried about the baby and I truly feel like if the situation was reversed there would have already been an amber alert and authorities everywhere looking for him. 
She has a history of depression and other issues and we are honestly worried about the child.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated, sorry for the extremely long post!",0
"Open Container Ticket in Manhattan (NY), Understanding Pink Summons. I was picked out by an officer outside of a concert venue while drinking a tall boy of Coors Banquet in a brown paper bag within a black plastic bag.

&amp;nbsp;

The officer seemed to be helping out another officer. The first officer (Officer A) came up to me and took the beverage out of my hand and glanced at it then dumped it, he then ignored me for 60 seconds or so and began given instruction to the other officer (Officer B). Eventually Officer A asked for my license and I asked him what I was being charged with. He told me I had an open container. I told him it was concealed to which Officer A told me there was no such thing/law (he is right, here) and that it was in plain view. I handed over my ticket and waited for about 3-4 minutes while Officer B was being fed answers by Officer A. Officer B finally spoke while reading my license and asked for my age while looking at the ticket, I told him 22 (I am 22) and he proceeded with writing the ticket. Officer A told Officer B what to right, picked the can of alcoholic back up for a glance and told him to write Coors Light 24oz (it was a Coors Banquet though). Officer B then handed me my license and a pink slip (A Pink Summons) which he tore out of his pad (it was one of those carbon copy pads which has multiple colored copies of your writing).

&amp;nbsp;

The Violation is a 10-125B which refers to Open Container laws (open container in public view). In Manhattan, these tickets are given all the time and so for Manhattan, this ticket is tied to Civil Court and is limited to $25 if I mail in a guilty plea within 10 days of the ticket or can be paid online through a government site.

&amp;nbsp;

I am not seeking legal advice of how to fight the case in court or anything. This tickets are common and since I am over the legal age, I won't have trouble telling an employer (if they even go as far as to delve that deep into my civil record) about the offence. My issues are with the ticket itself and paying it off. I can't find ***any*** helpful, **updated** info online and with the ticket given (7/7/17), I am trying not to run out of time. I live about 2 hours out on Long Island and so the cost of travel to and from this court would be higher than paying the ticket (this does not include the time it would take also). *How convenient of NYS lol*

&amp;nbsp;

I have never paid a mail order before and so I decided to put the $25 into my bank account to make paying easier (rather than being stuck with a physical amount of cash I can't mail in). After reading the back of my Pink Summons, it says I could use the site http://a836-citypay.nyc.gov/city/ecb . I was curious to see if I could just pay and plead guilty (I'd rather not plead guilty, but for such a minor infraction and fine, I don't mind) online and avoid the hassle even further. On this NYC website, it shows an example of my ticket and where to find a ticket number. The ticket shown is different than my ticket and I could not find any relevant ticket number that worked (I tried the 10 digit number under the barcode which also is the Summons Number). I then used the second option to look up my ticket online, I gave the dates and the  area it occurred and my name. This also did not work. I realized that Officer B, wrote in my last name wrong, so I typed in the info with my name the way he spelt it (His handwriting is reasonably legible and in all caps which helps). Still did not pull up my ticket. It said that the ticket may not be in the system and may still be being processed (but it is 7/10/17 today and I don't want to risk missing the 10 day window to pay with ease).

&amp;nbsp;

At this point I looked online at other Pink Summons from NYC and found nothing that looked like my ticket and nothing that was as recent as 2017 (they could have updated the tickets).

&amp;nbsp;

Now, more irritated with the ticket than I originally was after not being able to easily pay online. I decided to look more into the ticket itself. It says at the top it is a ""SUMMONS. FOR CIVIL PENALTIES ONLY"" and underneath the hearing date is says ""OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE TRIALS AND HEARINGS (ECB)"". On all government sites etc. that name is shorted to ""OATH"" and ""ECB"" is separate and associated with the ""Environmental Control Board"".

&amp;nbsp;

All information I found online with OATH and ECB are linked to building violations and such. Some are linked to biking on sidewalks. I do not see any relevant help for Open Container violations (10-125B).

&amp;nbsp;

Did Officer B, who wrote my ticket, issue me the wrong ticket or something? Officer B only gave one name which is not very legible (First or Last but not both and is complex enough to seem like his last name) as the ""COMPLAINANTS NAME"" and there is no easy way to contact the NYPD and find this specific charge without most likely spending some substantial time to help incriminate myself (plead guilty and pay).

&amp;nbsp;

So am I mistaken and this 10-125B ticket pertain to the OATH under the ECB and if I want to Plead Guilty, I should just find ignore the online site and pay a money order at the post office? Or is this ticket incorrect in some way and I can make a call to some dept. or official in NYC and get this ticket dropped?",0
"Car Towed and Possible Police Misconduct/Targeting?. Currently, I live with my bf who owns 2 vehicles. Unfortunately, our apartment complex only allows one parking spot per person living in the apartment. I have 1 car and my boyfriend has 2 which obviously leaves us one space short. The next part of the story is super important, at the time of move in and multiple times afterwards (via email as well as verbal) the apartment complex I currently live in told us that the street across from our apartment is a public street meaning that we could park our extra vehicle on that street without paying for an additional spot. That was what we thought was the end of that. Additionally, at least 20-30 cars park on this street daily as spill over from our complex.

My boyfriend primarily uses one car over the other; however, both cars have been used throughout the 8 months we have lived there and we have never had issues up until this point. 

A little bit of background on a separate incident but related in the sense that the same officer has issued all the tickets to the vehicle in question:

On 12/16/2016 my boyfriend received a parking ticket for being ""more than 12 inches away from the curb"". Not really thinking to take a picture of the vehicle before moving it, accepted the ticket and paid the appropriate fee.

Back to the current story:

After running into my neighbors and talking to them about what happened everyone I talked to had similar stories! I figured ""I guess this is how the police deal with their time in a sleepy town and while annoying parking tickets are apart of life"". I sent an email to my leasing office explaining the situation and the leasing office sent a reply saying their policies are their policies and to their understanding we are legally allowed to park on that street. I still have a copy of this email for my own records.

On 06/08/2017 we received a warning stating a ""dead"" vehicle has been left on public property and to avoid the tow we needed to move the vehicle to a different location (I do have this warning but it is not with me. I can upload this ticket late if need be). So not thinking much of it, my boyfriend moved the vehicle a couple of streets over with additional public parking(which I pass on my way to work everyday and can visually see the windshield and would noticed any ticket or warning).

On 06/29/2017 on my way to work I noticed that the car was not in it's normal ""spot"" which I check daily on my way to work. I sincerely make it a point to check everyday as we almost missed the deadline to pay for the first ticket due not seeing the ticket. I frantically call my boyfriend and explain whats going on. At first we thought the car had been stolen but after looking online realized it could have been towed. We contacted the local tow company and sure enough that was the case.

We promptly went to go retrieve the car; however; because the police department was the one who issued the tow, we could not retrieve the car until we have payed the associated fees with the police department. Great. At this point we were livid as we had never received any notification that car was going to be towed. 

We go to the police department and to our utter shock there were apparently 2 outstanding parking tickets for ""parking without permission on public property"" (WTF does that even mean?!?!) and that we had received ANOTHER warning stating a ""dead"" vehicle has been left on public property and to avoid the tow we needed to move the vehicle to a different location. Outraged we said we were never notified of the tickets or the second warning to move the vehicle (The tickets are bright pink and I visually check the windshield daily and would have noticed these tickets/warning) and would be appealing them but unfortunately we were told we had to pay the additional associated fees if we wanted to retrieve the car from the impound lot. Additionally, we stated we had moved the vehicle after the first ""dead"" vehicle warning so clearly it was not a dead vehicle. The clerk stated all she could do was give us the tickets and pay the fee but if we wanted to appeal the tickets we would have to submit additional paperwork (we have the paperwork and are currently filling it out). 

We then retrieved the car which had NO PARKING TICKETS ON THE WINDSHEILD and after getting home a reviewing the tickets realized ALL THE TICKETS WERE ISSUED BY THE SAME OFFICER!!! Including the first parking tickets we received in December.

I have no clue if what is going on is illegal or not and I am just really looking for advice on how to move forward. This situation does not read right to me and after everything is all said and done (and if we end up having to pay the tickets) we will have sunk 1k into this whole ordeal.

I can't help but to feel we were specifically targeted as about 20-30 people park on the street across from our complex all the time and never get towed. My head is spinning and the idea that a police officer can get away with what has happened sickens. I'm also having a hard time stomaching a 1k loss without any idea on how to prevent it in the future as my bf was about to go to college and we had to dip into that money to cover this expense. 

/r/legaladvice please help. What can I do? Is this legal? Should I file a complaint against the police officer?",0
"Scammed At Miami Strip Club. This is a long one: 

My boyfriend (of 5 years) &amp; I went down to Miami to vacation with my sister and her husband. Our last weekend night there we decided to have a good time. We went to a few dance clubs and met up with 2 friends we had met in our hotel. My sister &amp; her SO decide to leave, but the other 4 of us stay back. After the club closed the one girl calls a Lyft to get us back to our hotel. The lyft driver some how convinced us we needed one more drink and that we should check out this 24/7 strip joint. We're all quite drunk and we're on vacation so we say hell lets do it. 

We get there and drinks / entrance everything is so expensive, but non-the-less we decide to stay. I go to the bathroom and when I come out my boyfriend is no where to be found. He's a stand up guy, a hard worker, and never would have gone to this joint had it not been for me (oops). Anyways, I'm frantically looking for him, but this place is HUGE with multiple stories and various rooms, I cannot find him for a good half hour. Finally I see a stripper walking him somewhere while holding his hand. I run up to them and say what in the world is going on. Anyways, I bolt out, he tried to run after me, but I leave the club. Not thinking clearly, I'm drunk, hes totally wasted, &amp;  also it is 7am. He runs after me but I'm already in my own Lyft going to the hotel. 

I finally crash, but wake up around 10 am realizing he never came in. My heart drops, he could be anywhere or dead! I call and text yet get no reply (only to find out that the club had seen all my calls and put his phone on do not disturb!!). I try to call the club (which like I said was 24/7) yet all I could get was automated message saying ""all circuits are busy please try your call again later"". I decide to go back and look for him because the alcohol has faded away and I genuinely was worried for his safety. I get there around 1030/11 am and see him completely passed out face down on a couch, hes not even remotely conscious. He should have never even been served anymore alcohol! The manager and a worker try to give him water but hes just slumped over and cannot even open his eyes. The manager told me he spent 2k on a private room and that he signed off  on it. The poor guy couldn't even spell his name, let alone sign off on anything. He has absolutely zero recollection of what happened and we're an honest couple so he would tell me the truth. I take him back to the hotel room and he passes out until 7pm that evening.

Once he wakes up we try to piece together what happened and decide to enjoy our last evening since its our last night. 2k is a lot of money, but it wasn't the end up the world.

This all happened between 7am-1030am on Sunday morning. Flash forward to Wednesday, and we find that multiple cards have been charged for a total of  over 7k!!! Plus cash was taken out from his bank account. There are no receipts proving anything, and the manager himself had said it was only 2k he spent. We called our credit cards and filled them in so they're going to do an investigation, but we have no idea where to go from here. I called the club and they won't do anything until we sign off on a form, which we don't feel comfortable doing because they obviously are scammers. We've since found this place has reviews online that similar things have happened to many other people. Some people claim they may have even been drugged, which honestly he very well could have been. I've never in 5 years have seem him in the state he was in when I went to pick him up that morning. It was pretty terrifying.

It seems to us after talking things over, that he was absolutely taken advantage of, and quite frankly robbed. This club is well known, so they must have video footage. With me being a witness picking him up I feel we may have some grounds to stand on to get at least SOME money back. We're just nervous to move anything forward, because from what it sounds this club has done some very shady things in the past.

We're just looking for any and all legal advice anyone can give.  What are our rights and how should we handle this? Do we contact the police? Should we fill out this affidavit from the strip club? We really have no idea what the protocol is, and no matter what there is no way he signed off on this many charges. They would have needed his signature over 8 times! The manager told me he had only signed once. So how are there this many charges?  The club will not give us any answers, and we're considering going to a lawyer, so we would appreciate any help we could get! Thanks!

TLDR; went to miami, drunkenly go to 24/7 strip club, lose boyfriend (who is 27 &amp; has never went to a strip club before), come back to said club frantically worried at 1030am, find boyfriend passed out on couch totally drugged/intoxicated, manager tells me he spent 2k, yet he was not even coherent enough to tell me his name, come back from vacation and multiple charges have been made on multiple cards for over 7k. We definitely got majorly scammed &amp; taken advantage of. We want to know what we can legally do. 

Thanks everyone!


I don't want any negative or rude comments, we already feel bad enough as it is. We never go to strip clubs, and after doing much research I've found this is a common scam, and we're just looking for any guidance.",0
"Verbal/nearly physical altercation with friend in NJ shore leads to noise complaint ticket for us both. Friend threatens to beat me and my fam to death. Tells me to pay ticket cause ""my fault."" I took ticket, not paying. Claims to sue. Counter-sue with death threat? More in description.. Okay so we were at a bar down the shore in Jersey, just us two. We have been friends for about 3-4 years now and we met through my cousin who went to high school with him. We have been going out together a lot lately on the weekends and everything seemed cool until a couple weeks ago when he called me out in our group chat about me never being the one to drive when we go out. I took it as a joke in the group chat but soon after I invited him to come out on said night with me to the shore and that I'd drive us down there.

So he agreed and when the day came he left his car at my house and we went in mine. Everything was going well the whole ride there and during the time we were at the bar. We started drinking at around 4pm and we had agreed that I would stop at 9 in case I would have to drive back (we had planned to stay at one of my friend's house nearby). Later on in the night at around 8:30pm, while I was at my peak of intoxication, I closed my eyes for a split second and rested my head back against a column that was behind me and in that moment a bouncer approached me and said ""alright, you're done."" and directed me towards the exit. So my friend followed, leaving behind the group of girls we met there. 

It was honestly the most bs way I've ever heard of anyone get kicked out of a bar, if anything I would've given myself a warning. But anyway, at this point I was pretty drunk so i can only remember certain instances until later on at night. So as we were on the street, he texted our group chat (which he tells everything on) saying ""(me) got us kicked out of the bar for being too drunk. If he says anything stupid imma knock him out."" I didn't like that whatsoever so as soon as I read that I snapped on him, basically telling him that he wont do shit and to stop running his mouth. In that moment I realized that this kid had a lot of bad energy held in towards me because he started to verbally go off on me as well saying disgraceful things and standing his ground as well. Not much time had passed until two police officers appeared from the shadows and began talking to us. I don't remember how the discussion with the officers went because I didn't know I had gotten cited a noise complaint ticket until the next morning. But anyway, that's what came out of that interaction with the officers. 

After the police left, we walked separate paths but both ended up at my car. When I saw him there I told him to fuck off and find another ride home, which was how angry i was towards him because we live almost an hour from the shore. So I stayed in my car until I got an answer from my other friend who has the house down the shore which wasn't until after midnight. 

As I was in the car, my friend who had freaked out on me continued his hateful rant towards me in the group chat, basically trying his hardest to make me sound like a loser. So what do I do? I gave him a bunch of sarcastic responses until he was infuriated enough to write: ""I will beat you to death. I will beat your dad and your siblings and your mom and your dog to death. I have lived through things you can't imagine."" Word for word, I have the screenshot. 

This one pushed it overboard for me. I called him and when he answered I was screaming and cursing him out and telling him to ""come do it then."" But nothing else significant happened that night. 

After i got home the next day, he texts me ""are your parents home?"" I said ""Why?"" he said ""I have to talk to them."" I said ""No you don't, you need to get your car and immediately get off my property."" to which he replied, ""I'm not paying this ticket, either you or your parents are paying for it because it was your fault."" 
I read this and out of the intention of avoiding any physical altercations on my property I said ""Give me the fucking ticket. You're not going anywhere near my family.""

He came, game me the ticket and I ripped it up after he left my property. Now I just paid mine ($290) and his court date is tomorrow if he doesn't pay it off which he can't do now because he needs to mail in a check with the ticket itself. Noise complaint tickets can't be paid online in this municipal bureau which I just found out today, if I knew before i wouldn't have torn it up. I sent him a picture of the summons #, court ID, etc. a couple of days ago thinking he'd be able to pay it off online after he sucks up his pride. 

He claimed he would sue me because I ""agreed to pay his ticket"" and he screenshot my ""give me the fucking ticket"" text. can he effectively use that against me? I said that to get him off my case with the intention of giving him all the ticket info through text afterwards. When he told me he'd sue me I said i would bring up his death threats towards me and my family. 

So if he doesn't show up to his court date tomorrow to plead not-guilty and actually does go through with his claim to sue me, would his case be valid enough for the judge to rule me as responsible for his ticket payment? If so, how would I go about a counter-sue in the unrelated matter of him threatening to kill my family?

Thanks in advance.",0
"TN. Realtors are trying to take ~$48k of my mom's money.. Throw away account used as precautionary measure.

**Short version**

Mom got in over her head and made a lot of bad decisions, potentially out of cognitive incompetence, in regard to buying a house she couldn’t afford. She put $97k down in earnest money. We now need to back out of the deal and the realtor has decided that they want half ($48500) for compensation of damages.

**Long version**

My dad died just a few weeks ago. Before then I had been pretty estranged from the family, but came back for the funeral. My mom and dad were getting divorced at the time and my mom had plans to move to a house she was intending to buy in TN and was anxious to get the money she was owed from the settlement of the divorce to pay for her home. My brother and I were appointed as co trustees of my Father’s estate, and as I started pouring through the asset inventory I realized things were messed up beyond normal comprehension. Here is a summary of what happened according to the pieces of the puzzle that I have. 

Please note there is a good chance that there are inaccuracies to this summary, there are still missing pieces to the puzzle.

When my mom realized she was getting divorced from my dad, she started looking for a home. She had recently reconnected with her brother in TN, who in turn brought her down and started showing her properties in the area to purchase with the money she was expecting to get as part of her divorce settlement. They found a house that she liked that was being sold by a realtor that owned the property in question. A purchase agreement was signed. My uncle acted as proxy and signed the paperwork, putting down earnest money. There were conditions on the purchase agreement that a barn on the property needed to be finished (to date this is not done), and that my mom had to come up with the rest of the money including a mortgage.

There were complications with the divorce, things were taking longer than expected. The due date for closing on the house was drawing close fast. My mom made arrangements with the realtors to extend the contract, but it was conditional on her sending more money. The realtor didn’t specify how much money, but stated that more would be needed in order to extend. My mom wanted to show that she was very interested in the property and after withdrawing from an investment, sent $100k down to add to the earnest money via my uncle. My uncle was owed money for what he originally put down as earnest money so he repaid himself out of the $100k, which no one takes issues with, and then gave the rest to the realtor, bringing the value of the earnest money account to $97k. Which for those of you who are familiar with purchasing a home know is completely absurd. Obviously the realtors were happy to take it and weren’t going to argue.

The divorce takes longer, papers aren’t getting signed. Cue dad’s death and me making my way back into the life of my family. The new contract is set to expire in 20 days and mom needs assets to pay off the rest of the house. Things are complicated because the divorce was in a weird stage when he died, but I at least know what mom was owed.

The problem is that the vast majority of the cash that was coming her way via the settlement was in tax deferred investment vehicles, nothing that can be liquidated rapid without taking serious hits from the IRS. All of the non-deferred investments were emptied to send down what money she already sent. She was getting some money every month, but likely not enough to make a mortgage payment without making serious adjustments to her lifestyle. Long story short, she didn’t have the money to be able to close on the house and wasn’t going to be able to get the money.

This is only the tip of the iceberg. My brother and I quickly discovered that mom had been making a lot of bad choices in regard to her personal finance as well as other parts of her life that I would rather not get into publicly. There may be a cognitive issue. She’s going to be okay, but it’s yet another reason why a mortgage is out of the question. Plus after what we’ve witnessed we’re not okay with her leaving the state and want her to stay close to her remaining nuclear family so we can help deal with whatever it is that’s going on.

I immediately injected myself into her financial life. Over the course of 5 weeks and well over a hundred hours of phone calls, emails, etc, I was able to keep shit from hitting the fan in other areas, but not this one. I called the realtor and started negotiating us backing out of the deal. The guy seemed cordial enough, understanding, etc, but was frustrated with how this had all be tied up for months. Over the last couple weeks we’ve been talking about the scenario. They finally met with their lawyers and the have emailed stating that they believe that they are legally entitled to all of the money, but only want half, $48500, in repayment for damages including lost commission on the sale.

Obviously what money we lose is going to have a serious impact on quality of life for my mom long term. We don’t want her to buy the house, we don’t want her to leave her nuclear family due to everything we’ve witnessed, even if we did there’s no way to get the money needed to close the house, a mortgage is out of the question.

Any thoughts are appreciated.",1
"I paid to rent a home from a vacation rental company and the minute I arrived to the home, they cancelled my reservation.. Hello,

I am absolutely infuriated by this situation and wanted to know if anyone had any advice on what to do. I personally live in Arizona, however this company is located in Southern California, Newport CA to be exact. 

So I rented a home at the beginning of May for the fourth of July weekend for me and 4 of my friends. I am 22 years old and wanted a place for me and all of my friends who have recently graduated to rekindle and hangout for the 4th of july. My friends and I each paid an even amount for the rental and gave it to my friend Joe. I went ahead and made the reservation and paid for the reservation with Joe's card. The full amount (roughly $4,000) was charged to the card immediately after making the reservation. The company sent me a confirmation email stating that the reservation had been made and sent me a bunch of information, including and email stating that the realtor would send me the lock combination to get into the home closer to the date of our stay.

I want to make it clear that a lot of homes in newport require you to be roughly 30 or older to rent a home. That is why I searched for days and finally found a rental company that allowed you to make reservations as long as you were 21 years of age or older. Considering that I, along with everyone in my party, was over the age of 21, I found that home to be perfect for us. 

Fast forward to the day that we are supposed to arrive. We had the place booked for July 2nd-6th. On July 1st, at 5pm in the afternoon, I recieved an email requesting a photo of myself, a photo of my driverse license and a picture of the card on file. Unfortunately since I was traveling, I did not see the email until the next morning. (July 1st was a sunday, I did not expect to recieve an email on a sunday from them) Anyways, the very next morning I was happy to send them all of my information, however I explained to the realtor that I did not have a copy of the card on file considering that it had been lost by my friend Joe a few weeks back and he had since replaced the card. The reservation had already been paid in full nearly two months prior. Immediately after stating this, she said she would have to speak with a supervisor and get back to me. This was on July 2nd around 10 am, when our entire friend group had already traveled to newport and we were essentially pulling up to the driveway of the home. She then calls me back and states that since we do not have the card, that she has to cancel the reservation. She proceeded to cancel the reservation and said she would refund the money. I kindly explained to the realtor that the card had been cancelled, and that we would HAPPILY give them another card to keep on file for security purposes. She told me that since it wasnt the card that we paid with, there was nothing she can do. 

Since they sent me that email less than 24 hours prior to our check in time, I had no idea that they required that card from us. Or else I wouldve called and notified them prior. When I asked her ""how was I supposed to know"" she responded, ""its in the rental agreement"". I immediately read through the entire rental agreement from beginning to end and I found NOTHING that remotely mentions anything about us having to have the card. She then said that ""since the card doesnt match the name on file, that is a red flag, so we cancelled your reservation"". So at this point, I feel like I am being lied to because now shes changing stories as to why she cancelled the reservation. I called back and kindly spoke with a supervisor and asked them to show me where in the rental agreement it states that we need to provide a picture of the card on file, or where it states that the card used to make payment needs to match the reservation. She hostilly responded, ""Sir, this is not a negotiation. Your reservation has been cancelled. Goodbye."" and then hung up the phone. 

We were left there, sitting in front of the house, after traveling several hours, essentially homeless. They said that the money was refunded, however, that takes on average 3-5 business days, so we couldnt even use the $4,000 to rent another home or hotel room. We ended up having to pay for a hotel room for the night and buy flights back the next morning/drive back home. 

I am honestly at a loss for words about this situation. I could not believe that a company could do this to a client. I believe that when I sent her a picture of my driverse licsense, she saw that I was only 22 and figured that since it was the fourth of july, that they could rent the home to someone ""Better"" for more money. I eventually found out that they ended up renting the home to a husband and wife for the fourth of july. 

I am very upset because I had paid for this reservation two months prior, and they held the money in their account for 2 months. They then proceed to send me check in instructions less than 24 hours prior to my check in, and then cancelled the reservation. I do not understand how they can get away with this. I wish they would atleast have contacted me with the check in instructions a few days prior to our reservation.

Does anyone know what kind of attorney I should speak with about this? Or does anyone have any advice who works in this industry? I would greatly appreciate all advice.

Sorry for the long post.

Thank you!",1
"[TX] My employment was recently terminated and they won't pay my commission.. Hi /r/legaladvice!

I have been working in a salon industry for a substantial amount of time and was even Assistant Manager at other salons I worked at. I recently moved home during my year off before grad school and I started working at a salon at the beginning of April. I told the owner that I would be leaving at the end of July to go to grad school which is why I refused a management position with his salon. During the interview I asked for a certain amount per hour and he increased the dollar amount without any provocation. I thought this was a great opportunity for me and I took the basic sales level position.


Upon starting my job I was given sales goals and was told (unlike many others) that as long as I hit my goal I would receive 10% commission. He handed me an employee handbook and as I started to read through it line by line the owner told me all I had to do was sign the last page. I told him that I just wanted to read through in case I needed to initial any part or if I had questions about a section. He instructed me that there was no other place to initial and that I don't have to read it because it was straight forward. He pressured me into signing the last page without being able to fully go over it and I was not given a copy of what I had signed despite me asking frequently for one. 

There weren't any problems in April or in May. I met all of my sales goals and was given my commission on the day it was promised. In early June I arrived at the salon location I was opening and found a letter he had left for me instructing that my hourly pay was now decreased by 20% with no mention of change in commission structure. The only other employees that received this letter were all going to school at the end of the summer but their letters stated specific hourly pay changes and changes in commission structure. Many employees quit but I decided to call the owner and alert him to the fact that I was promised at least a certain dollar amount per hour and it was his decision to increase it and now after the 20% decrease, I was below the amount I had asked for in my interview. He agreed and decided to bump my pay up to my requested amount in the interview. 

After this conversation took place, he then gave me a very high sales goal and put me at a salon that wasn't busy enough for me to meet it. However after a couple of weeks he and the scheduling manager began asking me if I could cover shifts at a busier store for other employees. After accepting the shifts I was now working full time (40hr/week) after just wanting to do a max of 30. On the final day of June I ended up selling $1300+ for the busy salon and surpassed my sales goal by $9. July 1st was the end of the week and I was already clocking in 40+ hours when I asked if I could go home early since the salon died down. There were multiple employees there who could have taken care of our clients. The assistant manager told me that it was ""ok for me to leave 1 hour early"" considering I had to go to a second job that night. The salon was closed Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday for 4th of July. On Wednesday I was scheduled for 11 hours, Thursday for 12 hours, and Friday for 11 hours. On Wednesday I had worked all day and did not take a break. I saw that we were slowing down at the end of the day and when another assistant manager came in to close (who would've taken all the appointments anyway thus leaving me with nothing to do) told me that I could leave early again since there were no clients coming in and I had already been there for 10 hours. I went home and heard nothing.

I came in on Thursday fully intending to work my 12 hour shift because Thursdays are very busy and I knew they would need help. I worked non stop without a break until 5pm when the owner (whom I haven't seen in days) comes in and hands me a letter that he is terminating my employment due to ""excessive absenteeism without the approval of a supervisor"". I was livid. I initialed the document that said that I did not agree with the terms on which I was being terminated and left. 

He is supposed to be paying out commission this week and I'm afraid he won't give it to me because a co-worker sent me a copy of the employee handbook which states on the last page that if you are terminated you are not entitled to you commission. I'm wondering if I have any legal recourse here. Clearly I was forced to sign a document in front of him and I wasn't able to read anything from it because he never sent me a copy and I feel like he took advantage of this situation because he clearly gave me a sales goal that I wasn't supposed to meet last month but I did and I feel like he's worming his way out of paying my commission. He knew that I would be giving my two weeks at the end of this week (after I was supposed to get my commission check) and I feel like he tried to beat me to the punch. I have NEVER been in trouble at this job and I know that he can terminate employment for whatever reason but I feel like I worked for free essentially. This commission check was supposed to be $500+ and help me for school.

TLDR; Was given a huge sales goal last month that wasn't intended to be reached. Surpassed the goal and the owner terminated my employment for things that were approved of by supervisors. Now I fear he won't pay me my commission due to an employee handbook he forced me to sign without reading.",0
"Threatened with Harassment, Job Loss, Social Pariah Status If I Do Not Comply To Demands - Central Indiana. I am located in Central Indiana. I did read the https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/ and searched for the situtation I am going through with terms I thought might yield results but didn't find anything.

**Friday - 7/7/2017 at 7:30 PM EST**

I received an email from an anonymous email address - no name and no way to track. They used [guerrilla mail](https://www.guerrillamail.com/), a disposable email account service.

It begins by them loosely describing themselves, they are local administrative professionals in and around the area of town I work/live. They state they had been talking to a woman who is cheating/cheated on her husband with me, and that they wanted to contact me to let me know what a bad person she is so I could dump her. In their research into me, as in the best way to contact me - reaching out to mutual friends (I'm assuming through facebook but I'm not sure); they stated they found out I was lying about certain aspects of my life. They say they found out I am lying about my relationship status in order to have relations with this other lady or go on woman/women hunting when I go out with friends/work colleagues.

They go onto say that if I do not correct my behavior they have up to 5 people willing to report me for harassment. They don't explicitly say within my office but I am assuming that is what they mean. They state they will contact my family (mother, sisters, aunts, etc.), girlfriend, friends, work colleagues, clients I work for - anyone/everyone to tell them I am this degenerate person they believe me to be. They promise they will make me a social leper and ""destroy"" me.

**Additional Info I Think Might Be Relevant** *If not I apologize.*

* The field I am currently in is business solutions for a client, on client premises - we provide office solutions for them. This is important to know because although I work in a room with 20 to 25 other peers and supervisors that are my direct co-workers/reports for the company I am hired through/with, I work in a client office on client premises with client provided equipment and materials, with 500 professionals in which we directly service throughout the day on high profile legal matters. There is nothing but face-to-face client contact, and we live and die by it. This is important because of this: The sender mentions my direct supervisor by name, as well as our main point of contact for our client; stating that if I ""correct"" my behavior that these two individuals wouldn't have to know about my indiscretions. This is when they also say if I correct my behavior said client contact and supervisor won't need to know about my indiscretions - I.E. they won't file harassment charges against me.

* I have never been disciplined for harassment, not with my current position and employer (where I have been for 4 years now) or any previous job. I am for all intense purposes a model employee as stated in my most recent employee review a few months ago.

**What I Have Done/Not Done so Far**

* I decided later in the evening on Friday I was going to have to have (?) a one-on-one meeting with my manager come Monday 7/10/2017 when my shift begins. I thought about giving him a brief overview of the email, but more or less my goal is to get ahead of this, incase any harassment claims come up then maybe it will give them less credibility. My other position in this meeting will be letting him know ahead of time that I will be contacting my companies HR department, in the hopes of achieving the same goal with them - so incase it gets all the way up to them then they at least have my statement on record.

* I have not given into their demands in which they wanted; which was photographic proof of a completed task they had set for me.

* I did not respond to their email, and I saved a PDF copy for my records.

**What Should/Can/Shouldn't I Do?**

* Is it wise I go to my manager and my HR department? I know my manager really well, and I think he'd back me up a lot against any accusations. But I am more worried corporate HR would simply fold me in half and kick me out the door.

* What are steps I can take to protect myself with my company but also legally outside of work?

* I don't necessarily have the money to hire a lawyer, but I could swing some funds to at least talk to one. What type of lawyer should/could I talk to about this and be consulted on for making future steps?

* Is there anything you can think of I haven't thought of to ask or that you could share just from reading my post?

* Is this kind of thing common?

* If all of this happens as they proclaim: Such as they contact my family/friends/co-workers/clients; they get these harassment charges filed against me either with my company/client/other - does this qualify as slander/defamation? I'm only really just becoming familiar with the terms (I've heard them before but after researching a bit more I'm realizing they don't mean exactly what I thought) so I apologize if I'm getting it wrong. But if these people do file harassment charges against me, should I counter persue them for false allegations/accusations? Could they be compelled to give up the name of the individual(s) who contacted them about me in order to pursue them?

If you have any questions I'll do what I can to answer them. I appreciate whatever info you guys might be able to provide.

Thanks and good luck out there.",0
"[US] Moving company legality questions (CT to AZ move). Backstory:
My girlfriend and I just moved from CT to AZ for her work and my school. We agreed to use a moving company to transport our belongings to AZ. We contracted Radius Moving and Storage Corp for approximately $3200 based on assumed square footage of boxes. We agreed to the date of 6/25 at 0900-1100 arrival time for pick up of boxes that we packed. Radius did a no call no show. I attempted to reach out to them via a number on their website once they were late. Neither my girlfriend or I could reach someone until around 3 hours past their designated time slot. This individual informed us that they don't know what happened to the first truck so they were going to send another truck with an ETA of 1600-1800. 1800 comes and goes, once again we try to reach out to them and get the same no pick up or direct to voice mail treatment we were exposed to the first time around. Around 2000 we finally get ahold of someone. He said that the 2nd truck was involved in an accident. While unfortunate this still leaves us without a moving truck. After a lengthy back and forth conversation the individual said he would get us a truck for 0700-0900 time slot tomorrow (6/26). I get up around 0630 to ensure everything is lined up for their arrival. 0900 comes and goes no call no show. The next couple hours are filled with the same phone call avoidance and general neglect for our situation that we had become accustom to. Finally around 1300 a car and truck arrive to pack up our things. They left around 1630 with our things.


The overall treatment of company and the lack of professionalism in their response and customer service was deplorable. I was in the military for 9+ years and moved a bunch of times, i had never received this kind of treatment. Due to this and the fact that they were over 30 hrs late past our agreed time, my girlfriend and I believed we should get some money off of the final cost of the move (4300$). They said that 100$ should suffice, which is a slap in the face. Over the last couple weeks my girlfriend has been on the phone with them every day to try and track down our stuff which hasn't even left CT. Reading through their contract it says they can take up to 30 working days to deliver our things. Which is same time then it takes to get household good delivered from Hawaii to NY. After all this we asked for more money off. They told us that since we had written a negative review of them on the internet they would not give us any additional money off. We had not written anything yet which means we are not an isolated incident. As such they said they would give us 300$ off but we had to sign a contract prior to receiving the money. 



The question:
How is the below contract even legal? What can be done legally to this company? We are already planning on writing up a formal complaint with the BBB. 


It feels like this is blackmail to ensure we don't write a scathing review of their practices.

"[Texas] Issues with ex-landlord, security deposit, etc... (Warning, long, but necessary). Nearly 2 years ago my husband and I signed a lease to rent a house. The owner of the home had contracted with a company to handle all the legal paperwork, collection of rent, repairs etc...The lease agreement stated that once the lease up after a year we can either sign a new lease for a year or it goes month to month. 

Last year nearing the time the lease was going to be up for renewal, our contact at the rental company told us that the owner was ""considering selling the house"" and that we would be going month to month instead of another year long lease agreement. 
We were ok with this. 

End of the March 2017, a major hail storm sweeps through and most of the homes in our town had some sort of damage. 
Our home had a window broke and enough damage to the roof that the ceiling right inside the front door was leaking and a small ( maybe an inch wide after 2 rains ) appeared. 

My husband called the day after the hailstorm and left a message about the damage from the storm. 

No Response. 

A week later he calls again, brings up the damages from the hailstorm and also informs them that the day before this call the air conditioning unit had stopped working.  He is  told to use the website they have to inform them about the damage and to schedule repairs. 

My husband did what they told him to do . 

Someone did come out and tape heavy plastic up to cover the broken window and fix the pressing issues surrounding the air conditioning. 

After that, nothing is done about the roof nor is the window repaired. 

2 weeks later he calls again and gets a call back from the contact person informing him that our landlord wants to sell the home. If we want to buy it we have first right of refusal.

After maybe an hour long discussion we decided we didn't want to buy that house and we started to look for a new rental. 

We were fortunate enough to find a home close buy that met our needs, contacted the rental agent, were approved with in a week. 

We then went about and gave a 45 day written notice to our current contact at the rental company.  We also wrote a short paragraph on the contact website that stated while we were moving out we still expected to have the roof and window fixed. 

While all this time has passed no one has come to fix the window or the roof. 

We proceeded to move into our new home. We pack, we move, we clean, etc....
At one point the contact did come over to take pictures of the window and damage to the ceiling caused by damage to the roof. He informed my husband that they would be flying a drone over the house to access the damage. 

3 days before our final day of the old house, we got a call saying someone from a carpet company was coming over to measure the rooms because the home would be listed for sale the week after we move out.  We let him in, it took a few minutes, and he left. 


Our last day there we had the carpets cleaned , by a company we used before. Same guy came out, and we chatted before and I asked him about the quality of the carpets. He informed me I would be hard pressed to find cheaper carpets out there. I left the receipt for the carpet cleaning on the counter for the rental company to see that I had in good faith, according our our lease, had the carpets cleaned as we were moving out. 

The window was still broken when we moved out. As for the roof being fixed, I don't know. I had gotten sick and wasn't able to go to the house for a week and half, so it might have gotten done in that time.

So now it's June 3, more than 2 months since the hailstorm. 
We have moved out, and are awaiting our security deposit. 
Halfway through the next month my husband checked the website that we used to contact the rental company about repairs, maintenance and pay rent, etc...

He sees a charge on there for $700 and some change, which we automatically assumed was for things I will admit were our liability. ( The carpet in my boys room did need replacing and they had accidentally knocked a hole in the wall which my husband repaired). 

My husband called twice in the next 2 weeks, left messages for the contact to call him. 

No response. 

We finally received a security deposit statement not quite 2 weeks ago. 

They charged $650 for touch up painting and repair. 
They also charge $2175 and change for carpet replacement. 

I now owe them money, allegedly. 

I was shocked but I guess I shouldn't be. 

I immediately googled my old address and the real estate listing came up. Lots of pictures attached. Not only has all the old carpet been replace, but its much nicer quality, and in rooms where there was no carpet. Also, the kitchen floor has had all the old flooring removed and new tile floors put in. The entire house has been repainted and the master bathroom tile floors have either been painted or replaced.

I should also had that in the years before we moved in, our neighbors had tried to reason with the rental company about an issue with the privacy fencing. 2 neighbors had to replace their fence portions and legally speaking ( according to them and town law) my rental company has to share the cost of the fence replacement. One neighbor claims she is owed a fair sum and they refuse to return her calls. One neighbor informed us as he was moving out that he spent years asking the rental company to replace our fence as it was an eye sore. 

If you have made it this far, Thank You. I am sorry its such a long post. I do appreciate any and all advice. Is this worth filing on my own or lawyer-ing up, do I have a case or should I just role over and pay them the $1500 they are alleging I owe. Should I be concerned of the counter suing us for anything above and beyond what is stated in the statement, ie the fence which is now in amazing condition compared to the what it was the last 2 years.",1
"[IL] Tenants left my house and violated their lease several times, what are my options?. Hello /r/legaladvice, this is a throwaway account for reasons. I rented my house in Illinois to a couple and their kids. They signed a lease for a year and a half. My dad and I manage the house and take care of any issues that may arise with the tenants. The first year or so of the lease was fine and we never had any severe issues with the tenants. However, the last 6 months or so of the lease were pretty rough for several reasons which I will elaborate on. The lease ended on the June 30th, 2017. It bears mentioning that the tenants hardly ever paid their rent on time and we always had to contact them in order to collect our rent. It was like pulling teeth. Now that they're gone, we realize that the house is in complete disarray and they left it much worse than they found it and we are trying to figure out what legal recourse we have, if any. Here's a list of the things that they did or didn't do that were in violation of their lease:

1) Like I said above, they almost never paid their rent on time. For example, they paid the month of May on June 16th, well over a month late. They always cited cash flow problems as the reason for this, and we tried to be as accommodating and understanding as possible so as to have a good relationship with them. That was probably a mistake on our part. We have emails and texts to prove this.

2) They refused to pay the month of June, citing that the security deposit covered it. The security deposit was indeed one month's rent, but it was not intended to be used as the last month unless we agreed to it.

3) We knocked a couple hundred dollars off their first month's rent at their request so they could fix certain things in the house when they moved in. We also offered to send someone to fix all these issues, but they claimed to want to do it themselves so we agreed. Also, any time they had an issue, we would try to send someone to fix it and then they would fix it themselves or just ignore us when we tried to schedule a visit. We have emails and texts to prove this.

4) They refused to let us show the house to potential renters or buyers, even though the lease stipulates that we can start showing the property during the last 60 days of their stay. They let our realtor into the house once, but never again after that. They wouldn't even allow us to put one of those locks on the house to put the keys in for other realtors. We have emails and texts to prove this.

5) They accused us of racism and harassment in June when we were trying to gain access to the house to start showing it and trying to get our rent money for May. They said that if they were white we would not be pressuring them as much. I don't think it means anything, but we are also a minority in this country, but we never played the race card because what's the point of that? It's also worth mentioning that my dad and I have been nothing but polite to them, we have never used harsh language or threatened them in any manner. We have emails and texts to prove this.

6) They refused to allow me to conduct a walk-through of the house before they left so I could assess its condition. Had the house been in good condition, we would have allowed them to use the security deposit as the last month's rent or reimbursed it to them.

7) Up until the last week of the lease, the woman had been our point of contact. My dad and I had always communicated with her and we had always done so respectfully, even towards the end of the lease when the relationship was starting to break down. During the last few days of the lease, she told us to communicate directly with her husband because we were stressing her out. Again, I need to mention that we always communicated respectfully and all we were trying to do was to have them honor the lease they signed. I contacted the husband about the walk-through via text message and he called me. He proceeded to yell obscenities at me, claiming I was harassing his wife, refusing to let me look at the house, and even threatening me and my dad with physical harm. I kept a cool head and did not curse or say anything impolite to him. He was angry because the lender of their new house called my dad for a reference, and my dad told them the truth about their late payments. We had no reason to lie on their behalf, but they saw this as us taking revenge on them. They didn't ever even give us a heads up that their lender might call us.

8) Their lease ended on June 30th, but they didn't completely move out until July 2nd. My dad emailed them asking them to deposit rent for those additional 2 days and they did not respond. We have emails and texts to prove this

9) They left the house in a very dirty condition. They crudely fixed holes their kids left on the walls, they pulled the handrail for the stairs completely out of the wall, they scratched the hardwood floors, broke several of the window blinds, left food in the fridge and freezer, left garbage all over the house, left huge boxes of trash in the garage, among several other things that they should have taken care of before leaving. The security deposit would usually cover a lot of this damage and work, but as explained above, they took that from us as well.

We talked to a friend of us who is a lawyer and he suggested that we send them a letter stating all the things they did and the amount of money it would cost to cover. Our friend also said that we should make it clear on the letter that if they do not pay us the amount, we will take them to small claims court. He said we should try to get a police officer to come with us to deliver the letter, as the guy has threatened us with violence in the past. We have a lot of emails and texts in which they pretty much incriminate themselves.

My questions for you guys are: What are our options? Would it be worth it to send them that letter? Do we have a case to take to small claims court? Should we be doing something else?

I appreciate any advice you guys can provide me and thank you in advance. Cheers.",1
"Problem with a landlord over parking. Hi, I am currently living in Chicago, IL with one other roommate. We just recently moved into a new place July 1st and I ran into some issues with the landlord. I was guaranteed a parking spot on the lease, and when I signed a lease with them the property manager told me there are 2~3 spots available in the garage so I can park whichever that's empty. They told me they are not sure which parking spot is available at the moment and they told me they will get back to me once they find out.

When I moved into the apartment, I saw a spot open so I parked there over the long weekend following 4th of July. I felt guilty parking in a random spot so I asked the property manager to let me know where my exact parking spot is. Since it was a holiday weekend, they got back to me pretty late and told me that I can park at parking spot #5 which is empty. I moved my car on July 5th to spot #5 until my neighbor came knocking on my door. He claimed that its his parking spot and politely asked me to move my car. He told me since he is moving out at the end of the month, I should try to take his spot once he leaves. I immediately called my property manager, who told me that there was a mistake, and that I should park at parking spot #10. I went down to the garage and checked spot #10 and there was no way I could fit my car in the spot. The spot was isolated from all other spots and it was impossible to fit my car there. I tried parking there numerous times but that only left my car with dents and scratches from my attempts. I called my property manager and told her that my car would not fit in there and asked her if she could either assign a different tenant to the parking spot and switch spots with me, or pay for a different parking garage until next month when my neighbor moves out so I can take spot #5. The property manager said she will ask the other tenants and will get back to me. I waited until night time but she never got back to me. So I left her a text message asking for a solution, but I never heard back. I didn't want to be a nuisance to my neighbor so I moved my car out of my garage and parked on the streets for the night. 

The next day, I still haven't heard anything from my property manager so I texted her again. She simply responded ""I haven't heard back from the tenants"". I asked her for a solution asap since my car got a parking ticket overnight for parking on the streets. She never replied again, so in the afternoon I left her a text message asking if she could pay for a difference in parking fee if I parked at a different parking garage, if she doesn't get back to me by EOD today. She never responded again. Since I did not want to get another parking ticket, I went and got a spot from different parking garage and texted her that I did so and I expect to receive some form of reimbursement from them. She finally responded by saying she had a family emergency and that unfortunately she cannot reimburse anything else but the original parking cost at the apartment. We had few text messages going back and forth, disputing over this issue and in the end I asked her to provide me a different contact information that I can talk to this issue about. 

The next morning I received a call from a different property manager at the company. She claimed that she is sorry for the issue I am going through, and she said she will ask the owner of the apartment if any reimbursement can be made. I asked her if I could possibly have the parking spot #5 next month when my neighbor's lease ends but she said she cannot guarantee it. I questioned the reason of ambiguity and later she agreed that I should get the parking spot #5 before anyone else since its on first come first serve basis.

After that call I forwarded her my receipt for other parking space and waited couple days. I haven't heard back anything for 5 days so I sent her a follow up email. She did not respond so I sent her another follow up email today, and got a response back from the original property manager. She said unfortunately she cannot make any reimbursement other than the original parking fee, and that she is not sure if I can get the parking spot #5 next month. I asked her what the reason is, and she called me on the phone for the response.

She explained that all unit leases are linked with parking spots and apparently my unit is linked to parking spot #10. She said all other tenants' leases specifies the parking spot number except for mine that just says ""assigned. $/month."" She said the leasing agents messed up when they made the lease and it should've included the spot # on the lease but it didn't. She also mentioned that its not her fault since the leasing agent was supposed to show my parking spot before I moved into the place, but this did not happen. I asked her why can't she just switch my parking spot with a new tenant, and she responded that the leasing agents already showed the new place and told the applicants that spot #5 is what they will be getting once they move in. She confirmed that as of today, no lease has been signed yet. I asked her multiple times if she could change the parking spots for me but she said she cannot guarantee anything. 

After the call, I contacted my neighbor and asked if the lease actually stated the parking spot # for them. He confirmed that it did, and that they actually had spot #10 on their lease until he asked the property manager to change the spot for them. He said he was able to change the spot from #10 to #5 on their lease. I was absolutely astounded how they were able to easily change my neighbor's parking spot, but not mine. I am yet to take any action from here and am wondering if I could possibly file a lawsuit against my landlord for a breach of contract or any applicable crime.

Sorry for such a long thread of text, and I very much appreciate your effort of reading this post. I feel like this is so unfair to me and I really need some advice on what actions I should take next.  Please let me know if anyone could provide me with an advice. Thank you so much in advance.",1
"[NY] My dog broke my neighbor's dog's leg on my property and the dog died during surgery for reasons unrelated to the injury and they now want us to pay for medical bills and dog cost.. So basically i live on a quarter mile long driveway that i share with my neighbor who we were always friends with and kind to but he is at the very beginning near the road and I am tucked away in the woods at the end of it.  We have beach access and our neighbors have right of way to use our driveway and a path on our property only as a means of traveling to and from the beach. They have come over numerous times without warning to watch the sunset on a section of our property that leads to the beach (rather than the actual beach because they can't make it down the waterfall/stream that leads to it).  We've asked them a few times now to let us know before hand (mainly after an incident where a bunch of strangers and cars unexpectedly showed up for homecoming pictures on our land not the beach) when they are going to come down and we have always been ok with them watching the sunsets on our property leading to the beach as long as they let us know ahead of time. So basically the other day while my mom was at work and my dad was working in our garage they showed up walking down the driveway uninvited and without plans of going to the beach. My dad was outside with our three dogs (Rottweiler, golden retriever, and weimaraner all sweet hearts with no previous signs of aggression even in a house with two toddlers) and my sisters when they decided to walk down with a stranger and there three dogs (a lab, a golden retriever, and an 8 week old Australian shepard puppy they just got a week ago but hasn't met my dogs before).  My neighbors were supposed to be getting married on the section of our property that they always watch the sunset on so they said they were walking down to show the guy they brought with him the work they thought they were going to be doing to our land in preparation for their wedding.  I was not home at the time but i guess while my neighbor was walking ahead with the stranger, his fiancé was standing on our property surrounded by her dogs and now my dogs who ran up to see what was going on. I'm not sure how long the dogs were interacting for but the puppy was new to all three of my full grown dogs and the rottweiler ended up biting her and breaking her leg.  She was taken to the vet and had four puncture wounds as well but they weren't serious.  We were all very surprised to hear of the situation and upset as we are all dog lovers and offered to help in some way but we've never been in this type of situation before and didn't know how payment would work for something like that (we were still going to try to help even if we weren't liable) but my neighbors seemed pretty cool about it and said that wasn't a big concern of there's at the moment. So the dog eventually went in for surgery but never woke up from the anesthesia (we're guessing the dog was given too much for it's young age) and our neighbor told us when it happened and said to not call or text today because his fiancé and step daughter were very angry (at us? the dog? themselves? idk). So the next day my dad was coming home from work and stopped coming down the driveway because my neighbor was out and apologized for the situation he was in and my neighbor went straight to telling my dad that he has a couple thousand dollar pet bill that he's going to send him as well as a receipt for the dog that they spent $2000 on at a pet store.  Now my parents were trying to handle this situation as nicely as possible since we felt terrible and have to continue to share a driveway and think about this relationship longterm but feel like we aren't really fully responsible and don't appreciate how our neighbor is acting like it's completely our/my dog's fault and is going to demand this money from us for the incident without taking any responsibility of his own.  We've tried contacting an attorney just to figure out if it truly is on us but all so far have only been for dog bites on humans. Sorry for the grammar mistakes this is just like the 10th time reciting this so I'm getting kind of tired of it and just wanted some other opinions and feedback on the situation.  After them demanding the money basically my parents don't really want to help them pay the bills at all unless they have to but we believe that my neighbors are mostly in the wrong here and that we definitely shouldn't have to worry about the cost of the dog when the vet is the one that killed it even though my dog caused the need for surgery.  Thank you so much for any feedback this is just causing my family a lot of stress and I'd be happy to elaborate more or clear things up that weren't explained well if questions come up.

TL;DR  Neighbors have always been close friends and are legally allowed to cross a piece of our property to reach a beach that only we have access to but they always stop before getting that far and hangout on our property.  They've unexpectedly dropped down numerous times after us asking for just a heads up beforehand but they thought it would be a good idea to do that the other day with no intentions of going to the beach, a stranger with them, and their three dogs (one of which is a brand new 8 week old puppy that my three big dogs have never met).  Eventually while they were down on my property, uninvited and not there for the reason their supposed to come down, my dog with no history of any aggression bit their puppy breaking his leg.  The dog needed surgery but died due to reasons unrelated to the injury and afterwards my neighbors started acting like it was all completely our fault and that we had to pay the full vet bill as well as the cost of the dog.

Also just an FYI incase it comes up, the beach I'm referring to is public but surrounded by 40 foot cliffs and we have access to the only semi easy way of getting down on our property but my neighbors never go all the way down to the public part they are supposed to (again this wasn't a big deal to us when they would tell us ahead of time)",0
"[Brooklyn, NY] Threatened with ""termination of tenancy"" due to noise complaints from downstairs neighbors. Need to shed some light on my rights.. Hi /r/legaladvice,

I'll try to keep this as brief as I can, but I'm sorry, I know it will be long. I live with my boyfriend in the top floor of an eight-unit rent-stabilized apartment building in Brooklyn. Since we moved in, we've been having issues with our downstairs neighbors. The weekend after we moved in, one of them knocked on our door and asked if we were doing construction because he heard banging coming from our unit. We told him no and left on a cordial, if weird, note. He approached us a few times over the following month or so about the ""banging,"" and we told him we'd buy additional carpeting (since we didn't move in with much, and there is an 80% carpeting clause in our lease), but he seemed very frustrated when we explained that we weren't doing anything other than walking around the apartment and making your garden variety apartment living noise. He hasn't approached us since and graduated soon after the last time we spoke to banging on the ceiling with a broomstick whenever he deemed us too loud, which started at about once a week and has since gone down to once a month at the absolute maximum, always at seemingly random times.

Management's involvement started with a phone call sometime in October asking us to buy additional carpeting, which we did. Ceiling banging continued, and in January our neighbors called 311 about the noise and the police came to our apartment. I was folding my laundry in silence at the time, it was 12PM, and my boyfriend was on his phone on the couch... no banging, no music playing, no nothing. We don't own a stereo or even a TV. The cops told me the downstairs neighbors are ""very dramatic"" and that they've been to the building before for similar complaints, and that I shouldn't worry about it.

My boyfriend called management immediately after and asked them to address the issue, and their response was to come and inspect our rugs, which they did in mid-February. In March we received a letter from them stating that they could hear someone walking around ""heavily"" in our apartment from downstairs and that we needed to purchase additional carpeting and padding, which we did. (The vast majority of the hardwood floor, aside from what's covered by furniture, is now carpeted, by the way—I'm confident it is at least 80%.) I spoke briefly with the building manager to confirm that we'd purchased the rugs they'd requested and to address the most recent complaint alleging loud banging, which had occurred earlier that day. I told her the truth—that I'd spent the morning on the phone on my couch talking with a potential employer and, after that, that I'd watched Youtube videos on our bed while my boyfriend took a shower... nothing louder than that—and that we'd heard what sounded like hammering coming from the downstairs apartment.

We heard virtually nothing from either the neighbors or management and assumed the issue was resolved until mid-June, when we received a letter from our landlord's attorney stating that ""it is believed [the noise emanating from your apartment] rises to the level of nuisance, potentially justifying the termination of your tenancy,"" and:

""You must ensure that you maintain a reasonable level of sound coming from your apartment. This must include a deliberate effort on your part to prevent excessive noise from your apartment, and the installation of soundproof padding under any and all rugs throughout the apartment. Should management receive any other complaints in regard to you and your invitees, we have been directed to seek the termination of your tenancy.""

We were understandably kind of flabbergasted by this, considering the only noise we make is really normal stuff—walking, opening and closing cabinets, cooking, showering, washing dishes—and, as I said, we have no stereo or TV (or pets, or kids) and have already purchased adequate carpeting. My boyfriend's parents spoke with a lawyer they know who advised that we should purchase soundproof rug pads and let the landlord know for now. We purchased pads (arriving tomorrow) and will confirm with management once we receive them, but I am really nervous about what the future holds considering what has happened thus far.

It's worth noting that there are no formal quiet hours in our lease—only the 80% carpeting clause, which we've complied with, and a vague statement that no tenant should disrupt the quiet enjoyment of another... nothing more official than that. It's also probably worth noting that there is renovation going on in both adjoining buildings and in another building two doors down, the noise from which we can hear (if only faintly) in our own unit. Like I said, our building is rent-stabilized, and we've never actually received a formal written complaint... we've only been notified that complaints have been received by management. I don't really know what the neighbors have been saying, other than that there is ""banging"" coming from our unit. Here are my questions:

* Do we have a legal right to know what these complaints actually say?
* Given what's written above, is an eviction proceeding even a realistic possibility? What sort of proof would the landlord need in order to bring us to court?
* Aside from buying the rug pads and informing our landlord that we've put them down, what can we do to advocate for ourselves? Is it worth seeing a lawyer and sending them a formal letter documenting that we've made reasonable accommodations and suggesting that perhaps the building—not us—is the problem... maybe asking them to test how noise travels or something? Our policy thus far has been to stay quiet and comply with requests, but it hasn't really seemed to, you know, work.
* If the landlord DOES try to evict us, what should we do?

We have the opportunity to renew our lease and would really prefer to stay for a variety of reasons, but I don't want to get myself into a legal pickle if I can avoid it (and only have until August 29th to decide). I appreciate any advice anyone can provide!",1
"My wife(25F) and I(28M) rent a basement apartment from a couple (25F, 25M). She harasses my wife who has known mental illness. Please help.. Sorry in advance for the long post, and formatting/spelling issues as I'm on mobile.

If you take the time to read it all, I'd really appreciate any help you can offer.

Hey Reddit, I don't have the resources to pay for an attorney's advice, and could really use some help. If you have any advice or have been in our situation, please share your knowledge.

It is helpful to not that my wife has various, diagnosed mental illness problems (generalized anxiety, PTSD, depression, borderline personality disorder.) And she takes prescribed meds to help treat these problems. This is known to my landlord and the upstairs couple and is the reason she has a service dog here.

Back story:
My wife and I rent a (kind of) basement apartment in Colorado. We have 2 rooms, living room/dining area, bathroom and kitchenette(fridge, a little counter space with 2 cupboards and 2 drawers). The upstairs couple has to come downstairs to use the washer and dryer, and we have to go upstairs for the kitchen to cook and wash dishes, etc. 

My landlord is the Aunt of the woman upstairs, and the mother of the woman upstairs is the owner of the house. 

I was originally told that my landlord was the owner of the house, and that the couple upstairs rented from her. A couple months into my lease, my landlord told me that the mother of the woman upstairs is the owner and that she bought the house for the couple upstairs because they have bad credit. So they claim it is their house but is actually in her mother's name. Hopefully that makes sense, it turned out to be a complicated situation.

Regardless of who owns the place, the Aunt is still my landlord(she is the landlord on the lease I signed, and I deal with her directly for any problems with my apartment or people upstairs, and also pay all my bills to her. So the upstairs couple is not involved(with me) at all when it comes to my living space downstairs or the house in general, unless she is harassing and causing problems. 

I have told the couple upstairs multiple times to leave my family alone, and to talk to my landlord about any issues they may have. 

We have lived here since the beginning of March, and signed a 6 month lease.

The problem:
The woman upstairs harasses my wife and I. It has happened about 4 time's since we have lived here. She has gotten in my face yelling, cursing and name calling once. 
This happened because I talked to my landlord about asking them to stop throwing their cigarette butts on the ground, as my 1 year old daughter was picking them up and putting them in her mouth.
Woman upstairs got mad because I wasn't ""adult enough"" to talk to them and had to bring her aunt into it. She also made it clear that we all need to talk to each other and get along because we live together.
I told her that we don't live together, my family rent's the basement, and that we are not here to make friends, but to live a peaceful life and raise our 2 kids.
This is when she began yelling at both of us and calling us names(with our kids present). My wife went inside while I finished my cigarette in the driveway. As I returned to the door to come inside, she began yelling again and cursing and name calling. I walked away and went inside to my basement. That is the only time she has started problems with me.
The other times have been harassing my wife.

The second time she got in my wife's face yelling, cursing and name calling. 

This started because we originally had an agreement to trade off every other weekend with them cleaning dog poop(we have a service dog for my wife, they have 2 dogs). They weren't holding up their end of the deal, so I told my landlord that I'd rather not trade off weeks, and simply clean up directly after my wife's dog poops. After my landlord talked to the woman about it, she became irate, came outside and got in my wife's face name calling and yelling at her(again with my kids present.) I was at work when this happened.

The landlord preferred that we continue trading weeks and I told her we'd try it again and that if there were problems again, we'd be only cleaning after my wife's dog. 

Today while I was at work, she began harassing my wife again, about how she needed to clean up the dog poop, walking around the yard pointing out dog piles. My wife cleaned it all up 2 days ago. She yelled and cursed, name calling again with my kids there. So my wife told her that we'd no longer be cleaning after their animals and would only be cleaning up directly behind my wife's dog when he goes. She wasn't happy, yelled about my wife being a bitch and some other names. 

My wife told her that she was sick of being harassed, and that this is the last time she'd warn her before she calls the police and reports her. 

I have spoken with my landlord each time this has happened, and my landlord has also told me that we're not the first tenants the woman has caused problems with. Landlord has apologized for her niece's behavior, admits that it is unacceptable, and told me that she knows how hard her niece is to live around. Landlord has spoken with the couple upstairs, but nothing changes.

My lease is up at the end of August, so it's not too far away. But, this woman upstairs treating my wife and our family as she has has been detrimental to my wife's mental health. Her mental health has increasingly gotten worse because of this woman's harassment and problems. Another 6 weeks is a very long time for my wife to keep experiencing this treatment, and I'm afraid it's only going to cause her more issues. 

Do I have any options to get out of my lease early and unpenalized? Or are we just trapped and stuck dealing with this crazy lady until the lease is up?

I'd sincerely appreciate and advice or words of wisdom about this as I'm completely lost and have no idea what to do stop it. 

Thanks Reddit.

"[Michigan, USA] Building-wide renovation has been disrupting my life in a major way for over two months. I've been a long-time lurker but never felt the need to post on Reddit until now. I'm desperate for some sort of help.

I live in a large apartment building. I'd estimate that we have about 300+ units. In April 2017, I was notified that a building-wide renovation was to take place, and that all of the North side of the building (which is where my unit looks out to) will have their windows replaced, so that the building looks like a tall glass tower. It would improve the building's appearance.

They told the tenants to keep things a few feet away from the window, as the windows will be removed. I had a bunch of books stacked against the window as well as some furniture, so I removed my books and stacked them on the floor and my furniture was off the window by maybe a foot (I live in &lt;400 sqft studio, so there wasn't room to move all of them and go about my normal life. I figured that the workers will eventually move them as they see fit.)

May rolls around, and every day at 7am, Mon-Sat, I am woken up with the sound of jackhammer drilling into the concrete (I don't know much about construction, all I can say is that I'm a heavy sleeper but I can't ignore this noise; I have slept through numerous block parties, however). The local bylaw says that quiet hours are over at 7am, and they start pretty much on the nose (or sometimes even 6:45am).

According to the timeline given, my floor should be under renovation between May 1 and June 15. So every day, I force myself to go to bed early (I'm a night owl, and I'm the most productive at night), because I don't want to be caught sleeping by these workers, or worse yet, maybe one day they'll remove my window and just basically enter my unit that way while I'm sleeping. There wasn't a single day where I felt comfortable falling asleep, because I really hated the idea of waking up with some stranger in the unit.

End of June rolls around, and my window hasn't been replaced yet. I am physically fatigued from not being able to sleep well, and I start to wonder if the one piece of notice telling me that ""they need intermittent access to my unit"" is still valid. Can a landlord even claim access to my unit for that long a period of time? I have no idea.

At the beginning of July, I get another notice saying that from July 5, they will begin the renovation of my floor. WTF? I've been anticipating their entry into my unit every day for the past two months. They tell me that it'll take another 5-10 business days.

I'm annoyed, but I had a business trip scheduled, scheduled to return on July 10. So I think, this will shave off a few days from having to wake up early and be stressed. From my previous experience with construction work though, I know that not everyone is super respectful of my space. So I think through the possible problems that might occur to my space while I'm away.

I post a note telling them that while they're welcome to use AC, to please shut them off when they leave. I likely have slight asthma (my sibling is a doctor and that's what I've been told, although it's mild enough that I never got officially diagnosed) so I never use AC, as AC actually makes me breathe not as well.

I worry that the dust will be everywhere, so I take out every bedsheet and cover all of my furniture.

When I came back a week later, at about 9pm, the AC was on. It was possibly on for a week straight, I have no idea. The workers had piled furniture onto my bed (like seriously, who even thinks that this is an option?) and they had grabbed my garbage can to use in their construction work. Likely they had also used other stuff (I just replaced my roll of kitchen towel before leaving, but there wasn't much left, although I can't prove it). My blinds were gone. Considering that the north wall of my unit is entirely glass (and there were construction platforms just outside my window), I feel that I can't go to sleep like this, as I have zero privacy. Also, there's a huge gap between where my old windows used to be and where there are the new windows now. I guess the space used to be filled with insulation, but now all of that is gone. With the insulation gone, my room is not soundproofed at all, and I can hear my neighbours' utensils clicking against their bowls/plates as they eat dinner, not to mention other everyday noises. They must have thrown old insulation of fibreglass on my bed at some point too, because my entire body itches Tuesday morning, and I pluck some light fibres off my body where it hurts the most.

I am livid, and I call the supervisor. She eventually picks up, and tells me that while she can install a ""zip wall,"" I'll have to deal with it for tonight as she doesn't want to drive in for an hour. She'll pay for the garbage can (this was 5 days ago, no news from her yet) and the electricity bill (the difference between last year's July and this year's July). 

So now, the situation is slightly better as the zip wall has been installed, although it makes my already small room very small. My furniture is also all piled up, so it makes normal life almost impossible. My couch is up against my piano so I can't use either, my table is right next to my bed so I have to eat on my bed. Although their promised 10 business days are almost up, no one has been in my unit since Monday (other than to install the zip wall) to finish the construction, even though I hear very loud noise every day.

With the lack of the soundproof system, I've set up an air mattress in my walk-in closet and I sleep there now, because I can't continue to go to bed at 3am and be woken up at 7am by loud noises. I've slept in my closet for four days now, and today, I realized how pathetic this is.

I'm just a renter, not a unit-owner. My life has been disrupted for two months, and I don't feel like I have my own space anymore, although I pay the (relatively high) rent of $1100/month. I also hate that the construction company (and hence the landlord) can just give me a notice for blocks of times and expect to enter my unit at any given time. I'm cranky and depressed because I can't sleep well, and I'm not really sure what options I have, because the construction company technically isn't doing anything illegal, as far as I know.

I'm not sure if my whining is just me being entitled, or if there is actually some legal recourse that I can pursue. I'm desperate for any advice. Thank you so much for reading this rant.",1
"I'm being scammed on my concrete driveway, and I really need your help (Atlanta, GA). First off, thank you for taking the time to read over my ordeal. Basically, I have a loose gravel driveway, and my wife and I are sick of tracking in dirt in the house. It’s seriously like a sandy beach in here. So I call around to a bunch of businesses, but I couldn’t find a concrete company to give me the time of day because everyone is slammed with business. Some companies were even sending me off with “I know a guy who knows a guy, his name is Jimmy, he might be able to help”. So I’m doing some more in depth Googling (Ha!), and I come across a website called Thumbtack. You type what it is that you need, and they send contractors your way. Too easy. I get a guy and he’s out at my house immediately that afternoon. He’s eager for the job, and quotes me $3975 for a new driveway. It’s 70 feet long, and 15 feet wide, with an additional slab on the side of our carport that is 20 feet long, and 4 feet wide. I couldn’t find a consistent number online that could give me a ball park price, so when Rudy comes out and gives me that price, I was pretty happy about it. 


Rudy said he was brand new to Thumbtack, so that’s why he didn’t have any ratings, but that he was licensed, bonded, and insured (he insisted that he wouldn’t be able to operate without it). I was hesitant because Rudy comes off as a fast talker, but decided to give him my business because he is a fellow veteran, and he needs the work. No biggie, I’m happy to help someone in a tight spot. Rudy explained that the job would be easy as there is no tear up (of existing concrete), and he would “take care of [me]” by pouring it 6 inches thick, and giving me wire mesh which came with a 2 year warranty. He says he’ll get his Bobcat out here, and it’ll go by real quick. I agree, so he sends me a contract, and asks for $2050 up front for materials, along with some photos of work that he’s done. I know you know where this is going, hang tight.


 I signed the contract and sent the money. Let’s go over the contract. What I linked is exactly what he sent. An MS Word, piece of hot garbage. They spelled my name wrong, spelled his name wrong, so I kicked it back and they fixed it, no biggie. Shortly after, he emailed me my receipt. He then calls me back and says that he needs $25 more to cover the credit card charges, fuck it, I’m excited to get a new driveway, so I agree (I know, just hush).  


The next day (13JUL2017), Rudy and his crew are out at my house at 9 am sharp. There’s a cranky old guy who’s got something like 50 years in the business, and two Mexicans who speak like 3 words of English. Everyone was cool, the Mexican guys were like a slapstick duo, talking shit to one another, and the old guy constantly bitching about them under his breath. I eventually brought out coffee, ice water, and oranges because when I used to do construction (pool enclosures), it was nice to do work for a homeowner who cared. I quickly noticed there was a lack of aforementioned Bobcat, so no dirt was getting dug, and Hose A and Hose B (that’s how cranky old man introduced them) were filling up a cracked and warped Rubbermaid tub full of dirt and sliding it back and forth between the side of the house and filling in the driveway. Again, me being an understanding person, I assumed that Rudy had his Bobcat out at another project (which I was correct), so I allowed his crew to use all my tools and wheelbarrow to make things go faster. I didn’t mind because I knew forming wasn’t going to take all day, and they’d be done in a few hours. 


About that time I notice cranky old guy laying down 2x4s. I walked up to him and asked him how thick the concrete was going to be. He said 4 inches. I said no, I signed a contract for 6 inches, and showed him. He said I’d have to talk to Rudy, because he wasn’t sure. So Rudy pulls up about 15 minutes later, and I ask him again about the thickness. He reassured me that the concrete would indeed be 6 inches thick, to not worry, because when it’s poured, it’ll “SINK DOWN”, and it’ll be 6 inches when he’s done. So I kept it in the back of my head, because it sounded like some cock and balls bullshit. Around 2 pm, the crew finishes forming up and Rudy walks up to me. He explains that, since the side of the house didn’t have any gravel like the front, it’s going to cost a little extra because he’s going to need more concrete, because it’s going to sink deeper into the soft ground back there. Ok, that one really threw up some red flags. That’s twice he’s asked for more money. I told him I would talk it over with the wife. What I really did was call around to about 5 different concrete companies. Each and every single one of them confirmed what I knew deep down inside: the guy is a scam artist, he’s taking me for my money, concrete sets at the thickness in which you pour it (i.e. it doesn’t sink), and that a contract is a contract, and I am not obligated to pay more than what I signed for. 


So embarrassed and downright ashamed of myself, I go online to see what can be done legally with people like him. I click on an Angie’s List article dealing with concrete repair scams, and LOW AND FUCKING BEHOLD, there is the exact same picture headlining the article that he sent to me, which he claimed was a previous project of his. Now I’m really pissed. I look back over the photos and my receipts, and wouldn’t you know it, at the bottom of the receipt is where he forged my signature. It’s so blatantly obvious that it was forged, it’s down right insulting. 


Here’s my conundrum: I’m no attorney, but I believe technically he hasn’t broken the contract yet because the concrete isn’t poured. It’s just 2x4s outlining the driveway. So I don’t think I have any ground to stand on by demanding my money back, do I? Either I want a complete refund, or I (reluctantly) want him to do the job that I paid him to do. I’m planning on calling him first thing tomorrow morning and recording the conversation. I called the bank, and they said they can open a dispute and refund me my money, but the ultimate decision would be left to the case manager as to whether or not I’m in the right (seeing as how I willingly agreed to give this person my money). 
Before he left, Rudy asked if he could finish the job on Monday because he had to go to Miami for the weekend, and couldn’t coordinate the cement trucks until late Friday night. So I said yes, that’s not a problem. He also asked me to call him later that night to let him know about the extra charges, and what I wanted to do. So I called twice and no answer. 

What are my options?

"[CA] I've moved out of an apartment, found someone to sublet, but still being harassed by roommates living in the apartment.. Hi all, this is going to be a bit long but I was hoping if I could gain some advice and tips.

On September 1, 2016, I've moved into an apartment with 4 other girls (R, H, N, and S). Four of us signed the lease, S couldn't sign the lease since the floor plan technically only allowed 4 people to live in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom.  My parents had cosigned the apartment for me and H's family cosigned for her. The apartment was located near a uni (this is important for me because I didn't want to spend 6 hours commuting every single day from my parent's house). Living with H and N was fine, but living with R and S was a nightmare, I personally have no problem with smoking as long as it's not in my room because the smell of weed gives me insane migraines, but they would smoke CONSTANTLY. They would leave the windows closed, play music super loud, and loot my pantry for food. We were given several warnings for the noise level in our apartment, but R and S paid no attention to this, possibly because R was an exchange student and she didn't give a fuck about being evicted or ruining her credit score. S wasn't on the lease so she didn't give a rat's ass. 

However, on December 2016 N decided that she wanted to move out because she was having a lot of issues with R (backstory: R and S didn't like N and was giving her a really hard time living at the apartment by being extremely passive aggressive). N was able to get off the lease since she was smart enough to sign a separate lease with the property manager from the beginning. H also left in December because she found a job and had graduated. H found someone to sublet her spot in the apartment, B. I had recommended B because she was my best friend. H was not fortunate enough to get her name removed from the lease like N was. 

Towards the end of December, R had suggested to me that we should have our mutual coworker, Z, live with us in the apartment, and she could take over N's space in the living room plus it would ultimately lower the cost of rent (500-ish per person). So Z moved in in the beginning of January 2017. I honestly did not like Z from my very first encounter with her at work. But I ignored it for the sake of cheap rent; I kept my distance from her just in case. R initially roomed with me, but when B moved in, B had asked to share a room with me since we are best friends. Everything was fine in the apartment because I do not interact with the girls much besides for B, I also leave on Fridays to go back home to see my parents for the weekends. B also leaves home for the weekend, so only R, S, and Z remained in the apartment. 

Around mid-April, I told R, S, Z, and B that I will be moving out in June because I will be graduating, so I asked them whether they wanted me to find a subletter, or they can find their own subletter. They decided that I should find my own subletter. So I took it upon myself to post on Facebook in some of our school groups to find people. On the post, I had listed the apartment like how it was advertised to me, ""Two-bed room, two baths, one parking spot available."" We had two parking spots one for B and one for myself, I do not have a car but my boyfriend does, so when he picks me up or spends the night there, he will park in the spot rather than parking on the street and risk a ticket, plus it made it easier for me when I drag my two luggage up to my apartment.  I got a text the next day from R who insisted that I should not include the parking space because the parking space should be reserved for them. I told R that this was unreasonable because no one in the apartment had a car beside for B. R, Z, and S began spamming my phone and insisted that I take off the parking space. To me, this was extremely unreasonable because I had begged the manager to give me that extra parking space for when my parents visit me during the week and for when my boyfriend picked me up.

I came back to the apartment the next day Sunday,  and this is when the shitstorm has brewed. Apparently, while I was gone Z got the idea to instigate shit with R, and S, by telling them that I had wanted S gone, and wanted to kick her out of the apartment since she is not on the lease. I HAVE NEVER SAID SUCH THING. I have mentioned to Z that I was worried about her and S being evicted out of the apartment if the manager knew that there was 5 of us living in the apartment. So while I was unpacking in my room, R barges in like a fucking bull and was being extremely aggressive and violent. She began hitting, and banging the walls, bitching, and insulting me; at this point I am terrified, I had never been treated this way or have had anything like this happened to me, so I should like a stone while my boyfriend asked that they leave my room. S then came out of nowhere and started crying asking if she could talk to me, at this point only half my brain was functioning because I'm still so shocked. The minute I walked out of my room, S, R, and Z began to insult and demanded that I removed the parking; they tried to pin everything on me and insisted that I'm at fault for posting the parking space and that I'm a vile bitch for wanting to kick S out. My boyfriend tried to intervene but these bitches are so persistent and threatened him to leave. At this point, I couldn't take it anymore because if I had sat there longer I would have broke. So I stood up and walked to my room. 

After the incident, I stayed in my room more frequently, I only came out of the room when I needed to eat or heat up food. I stopped cooking and using the kitchen beause it would meant seeing R, S and Z. A week after,  I tried to see an on-campus therapist because my anxiety was spinning out of control, and I couldn't hold down food that I ate. I knew myself and I knew my anxiety, so I seeked for help, but seeing the therapist wasn't much helpful since I was still returning to the toxic environment of the apartment. I finally found someone to take over my spot in the apartment, I'll call her Jo. I was worried that Jo would back out of the apartment, so I came to the lawyers at my uni to asked for help, they basically told me just to write an agreement between Jo and I stating that she is my subletter and that Jo wants to renew the lease once it ends in August 2017. However, this was not what I wanted, I also wanted to get out of the lease since my parents are also on the lease and I do not want to have any ties to the apartment once I move out. I tried asking the property manager if Jo could take over my lease, and they turned me flat down. I'm still stuck on the lease until August 31, 2017. Is there any way I can get myself off? I'm no longer living there. The property manager asked Jo to sign a paper to add herself as a subrenter, but Jo could not take over my lease because apparently there is ""no such thing."" Basically I can get out of the lease in August when I submit a 30 days noticed, but all of the tenants on the lease has to sign me out of the lease. 

A second issue that I have is with R, when I left the apartment in June, I had told her that I will be cancelling the electricity bills since it was under my name.  I came into work today and realize that R had ran to my supervisor saying that I had thrown her under the bus because I turned off the electricity and B moved out of the apartment. The day before, she had texted me and asked me for my social security nuber so she can access the electricity bills even though I have already canceled it, I turned her down but she thought this was a great excuse to bring up to my supervisor. This has made me feel extremely uncomfortable since I had never expected her to bring this personal issues to work, let alone tell my supervisor. She has constantly been bothering and harrassing me, when B left, she thinks that I should give her B's mom's phone number because they want the next month's rent.  Any tips on how I can deal with her?",1
"Can you tell me the steps to take to open a court case to put SO's mother in the states care?. Basically this situation is really fucked up and my GF is losing her sanity from her psychotic neurotic mother. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was told that I should open a case for the mother to request that she should be put in a home under the states care. 


We are in Washington County, Oregon. 

&amp;nbsp;


The mods asked me to remove the link to the google doc I have written up, so I will be posting it at the bottom of this post. 

A user to the original post wrote 
&gt; 
*If you are drafting and filing something on behalf of another you are engaging in the unauthorized practice of law*

But I was told that in a circumstance like this, when the person is unfit to make the decision to be put in care, you open up a court case and let the state take over and make the decision to put the person under the states care. This person is unaware of her own mental state and the situation, is unable to comprehend what is happening. 

Furthermore, I don't have any idea how to write a legal document, so there is no way this post in its current form is a legal document. It's just a document. 

Since I didn't make it explicitly clear, there is no personal information here. at all. all names are fake. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I guess my specific question is what steps to take to open up this case, and what kind of actual legal document I should send over to the court to get this going. 
Civil court I think. 

Really I'd just like advice. Okay here's the post: 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


REQUEST FOR CASE TO BE OPENED FOR Bonnie Smith

CONTEXT: 

&amp;nbsp;

Jenny Smith (Female, 32) lives with her 4 children, mother Bonnie Smith(Female, 64) and Joe Lee(Male, 23, author of document). 

&amp;nbsp;

Bonnie is the current caregiver of Jenny’s son James Smith(5), who has a rare debilitating disability [redacted too specific]. Jenny took care of James when Bonnie was not working. 

&amp;nbsp;

The situation a few years ago was that Bonnie had her own apartment, Jenny had her own, and she came to the home only for her shifts, though she continually refused to leave the house. 


When Jenny moved to another house last year, Bonnie stayed at the new house longer and longer until she became considered a resident. Bonnie now takes care of James at all times. Bonnie also pays around half of the household bills. 

&amp;nbsp;

A DHS case was opened last year, where Jenny expressed that for several reasons she could no longer take care of James, among the main reasons being her mental health and that she could not live with Bonnie anymore. 

Different options were discussed, the main consensus was that Bonnie would move out of the house and continue taking care of James. 

&amp;nbsp;

We no longer believe that Bonnie is mentally sound enough, nor physically healthy enough to take care of herself and James. 
We also do not believe she is capable of holding a job. 
We believe she may benefit best under the care of the state. 

I (Joe) am soon going to attempt to take over the expenses of the house and Jenny is considering options for James including putting him in a home. 

&amp;nbsp;

We were already planning to open this case, the timing of when has sped up to now as 
Bonnie is currently threatening me (Joe) with a restraining order which would trap Jenny with her longer and affect my career,
Bonnie is acting increasingly mentally unsound, 
and Jenny is having a mental health crisis from prolonged exposure to this situation. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

REASONING:


Jenny says she feels she has no control over the house. 


Jenny says she feels that she cannot take care of the house while Bonnie is living here. 


Jenny says she feels trapped in the house and unable to leave. 


Jenny often feels she has to lock herself in her bedroom to avoid Bonnie. 


Jenny says her mental health is suffering from Bonnie and adds (paraphrased); 


‘Bonnie has driven her past the limits of her sanity.’


she ‘cannot handle this anymore.’


she ‘is unable to begin healing until Bonnie is gone.’ 


Jenny says she feels she cannot parent her children. 


We both worry the children have been damaged psychologically by Bonnie. 

&amp;nbsp;

Bonnie does not respect Jenny’s authority in any way. 


Bonnie refuses to leave the house. She makes it difficult for Jenny to leave the house.


Bonnie follows Jenny around the house and will not leave her alone when asked.

&amp;nbsp;

Bonnie acts “neurotic”(as an adjective) and believes that what she has to say must be said to Jenny, believing that there is an urgent matter to the point that she will stand outside of a locked door if Jenny is on the other side for long periods of time,

 growing increasingly worried and paranoid as time passes, 
more convinced of the urgency of her messages, raising her voice, beginning to whine cries, and changing the inflections of it ( it can sound like 3 people are talking). 


If Bonnie is left feeling like this, she will begin pacing around the house mumbling to herself and repeating phrases in a scared tone, then grow angry and yell at anyone nearby including the children, in between randomly chuckling and shaking her head. 


Bonnie will not sleep or rest during these times, and gets worse the longer she doesn’t sleep. 


Eventually she will begin threaten Jenny (normally that she will turn off Comcast) if she does not do what she wants.


Bonnie is not aware she is acts like this, and grows increasingly defensive if accused, shaking her head and laughing while saying “no, no, no” followed by threats. 


Bonnie will refuse to leave the house when she decides she needs to leave for the same reasons. 

&amp;nbsp;

The only way Bonnie will leave Jenny alone is if Jenny screams at and name calls her at the top of her lungs, and Bonnie will then calm down afterwards possibly for the rest of the day. 

&amp;nbsp;


If Bonnie cannot talk to Jenny, she will tell her paranoid thoughts and worries to the children. 
During any fight with anyone, Bonnie will yell in front of the children. 
One of Jenny’s children now screams and cries during these fights. 

&amp;nbsp;

If Jenny attempts to punish her children, 
Bonnie says the children have done nothing wrong, begs “Please stop Jenny, please stop”, then tells the children that everything is okay and that something is wrong with their mother, then rewards them. 

&amp;nbsp;


The children have learned that they can manipulate Bonnie, screaming at her and name calling her until they get what they want because she will whine and beg them to stop until she does what they say. 



If for example, Jenny tells Bonnie her daughter cannot play video games because she’s grounded, Bonnie will allow her to play when Jenny leaves the room. 


Bonnie believes that she should not listen to what Jenny says because Jenny is being manipulated by me(Joe). 

&amp;nbsp;


The children have come to know Bonnie’s behaviors as normalcy. 


Any attempt at bringing outside family help into the family results in Bonnie yelling at them, 


leaving them often traumatized within five minutes as they are not used to this kind of person. 

According to Jenny, Bonnie’s physical health is failing and she is barely able to take care of herself. 


Bonnie’s mental state has been the direct cause of her to get laid off at every job she has worked in the last decade before she began staying here. 

(for example, she was laid off at the most recent company because she repeatedly insisted that not having the American flag raised high enough was illegal.)

&amp;nbsp;


ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS FROM Jenny:

The only time Bonnie acts decent is when she is attempting to manipulate someone. 


Bonnie manipulates the children with gifts, and has taught them that if they are not being treated they are not loved. 

Bonnie poops and pees herself everyday and rarely bathes. 


Bonnie acts abusive and entitled after cleaning the house. 

Bonnie spends frivolously spends her income then claims that Jenny has taken her money. 


Bonnie attempts to make Jenny and the kids form sentimental attachments to trash so they will never throw anything away.(Note, she is a packrat)


Bonnie makes every situation miserable, is horrible to everyone even in public, no one ever feels peace. 


Bonnie denies and immediately forgets anything and everything she does.
 
Bonnie does not believe nor is aware that she is not wanted in the house.",0
"[ALBERTA, CANADA] Copyright infringement notice settlement?. So about a week ago I got a copyright infringement notice email forwarded to me by my ISP from Canipre (representing Elevation Pictures) about a movie that I don't remember downloading. Usually I would ignore these kinds of emails but this one seems pretty aggressive. Below is the email that was forwarded to me by my iSP. I've been told to not click on any links in the email so I did not do that. I did however visit the site where the settlement would be paid to and now I'm a little paranoid (I did not visit the specific link in the email, only the general front home page of that link). Is there anything I should worry about? I've been told by everyone and all the research I found said to ignore these notices and to continue to ignore them even if they send you more notices for the same copyright infringement.

"SAN DIEGO, CA - Booze cruise birthday party ended up being a scam, shady company is unresponsive. What can I do?. Hey, r/legaladvice. First time posting here, thanks in advance for responses and sorry in advance if I'm breaking rules. 

My problem is outlined below. My question really boils down to, what can I do about this?

Begin

*****

A couple of my friends have birthdays around the same time and decided that, to celebrate, we should get a group together and go on a sweet looking 90s booze cruise. Tickets were ~$65 and about 15 of us bought ticket, likely in addition to others. I will call the event company that was putting on the cruise EC for short and anonymity. EC sold the tickets through a separate company I will call TC for ticket company. The cruise was scheduled for the night of May 19th, and we bought tickets at least a week in advance. I personally bought 2 tickets.

The day of May 19th comes. It is hours before the planned starting time of the cruise, and I receive the following e-mail from TC on behalf of EC:

&gt; San Diego,
&gt;
&gt;We are having to postpone tonight's event due to a cancellation of the artist we had planned for you all tonight. we are sorry for the inconvenience. The new date will be on Saturday, July 29. Everyone's tickets for todays event will give you entry to July's event. If you have any questions or concerns or want to inquire about a refund then please contact us at [e-mail address for EC]
&gt;
&gt;Thank You

I immediately requested a refund, as did many of my friends. On May 21st, I received the following message (again from TC on behalf of 90s EC):

&gt;San Diego,
&gt;
&gt;People who requested refunds we have received your emails and please allow 5-7 business days to see it back in your account.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers!

I never got the refund, and most of my friends did not (though one did, strangely). On June 15th I contacted TC support saying:

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
&gt;I purchased tickets to the San Diego Booze Cruise which was scheduled for Friday, May 19th 2017. The day of the event of the cruise an e-mail was sent out informing me and the other customers the cruise was cancelled due to an artist cancellation and will be rescheduled. I requested a refund and was told via a mass e-mail that all refunds would be credited with 5-7 business days. It has been much longer than this time and a refund has not been credited. Friends of mine corroborate this.
&gt;
&gt;Promptly refund all tickets. Personally, I purchased two and should see a refund in the amount of $131.66
&gt;
&gt;[My Name]

TC responded saying:

&gt;Hi [My Name],
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for reaching out.
&gt;
&gt;Funds from ticket sales are held for 48 hours after the end of an event to allow time for buyers to dispute the charges. After 48 hours, the funds are paid out to the organizer and any refund requests must be processed by them outside of Universe. Although the organizers seem to have promised refunds, they did not issue those refunds at that time, nor did they reach out to us to issue them on their behalf.
&gt;
&gt;We have reached out to the organizers of this event to attempt to come to a reasonable solution to issue refunds on the event that was re-scheduled, however, they have not cooperated. Unfortunately as Universe no longer holds the funds for this event, all refund requests must be directed to the organizers of the event who can issue refunds at their discretion. They can be reached at [EC email address]
&gt;
&gt;We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers,
&gt;[EC name] Support

I responded to Universe saying:

&gt;Thank you for the info. Can you please send more contact info for the event managers? Phone number, company name, persons involved, etc.?

I also forwarded my exchange with TC to the contact email for EC and said the following, which they did not respond to:

&gt;Hi [EC name],
&gt;
&gt;Please see the message below regarding the San Diego Booze Cruise which was scheduled for, and canceled, last May. (Insert exchange with TC here)
&gt;
&gt;I am wondering why refunds have not been credited as promised? Please refund the tickets.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you,

I then sent TC this email before receiving a reply from my previous e mail:

&gt;Additionally, your service rules make the following points that sellers cannot (taken verbatim from contract on TC website):
&gt;
&gt;(7) offer, as a Seller, any items that you do not yourself own or have permission to rent (without limiting the foregoing, you will not list items as a Seller if you are serving in the capacity of a broker, rental agent or listing agent for a third party);
&gt;
&gt;(10) impersonate any person or entity, or falsify or otherwise misrepresent yourself or your affiliation with any person or entity;
&gt;
&gt;(13) as a Seller, submit any Listing with a false or misleading price information, or submit any Listing with a price, service or activity that you do not intend to honor.
&gt;
&gt;These terms are in question of being violated based on the way 90s booze cruise handled the event. There is no evidence they had owned or had permission to rent the service they offered. The fact that they canceled the event hours before the time is highly suspicious and suggestive that they never intended to honor their service. If either of the above is true, it follows that they misrepresented themselves and their affiliation with artists and vendors.
&gt;
&gt;I trust there will be proper due diligence with regards to these potential breaches of contract and that appropriate legal action will be taken if necessary.
&gt;
&gt;Please inform me how you plan to proceed.

I received no reply to this as well.

I disputed my charge for the tickets through my credit card and was promptly refunded. While my desire for justice was left unserved, and some of my friends never got their money back, I got my mine back and decided to put the matter to rest. However, I was surprised to get the following e-mail from TC this morning (July 17):

&gt;Hi [My Name],
&gt;
&gt;We are writing regarding the dispute for $130.00 USD charge to your card ending in XXXX on Monday, July 17, 2017.
&gt;
&gt;The charge was for 2 tickets to the 90s Booze Cruise- San Diego event.
&gt;
&gt;The organizer of this event, EC, uses TC to sell their tickets. The event took place on Friday, May 19, 2017. We have attached your tickets and receipt here.
&gt;
&gt;Please call the number on the back of your card to let your bank know that you understand what this charge is for and reply to let us know when you have done so.
&gt;
&gt;Best Regards,
&gt;
&gt;TC Support

I responded with the following lengthy message. My response includes a consolidation of all the communication between myself and Universe, so I have not included that since it has already been posted above. My response:

&gt;Dear TC,
&gt;
&gt;You are mistaken.
&gt;
&gt;This event did **not** take place on May 19, 2017. This event was **planned** for that day, however, it was canceled only hours before it was **planned** to start.
&gt;
&gt;*(Here I copy and paste the messages from Universe regarding the event being cancelled and then the promise to refund tickets).*
&gt;
&gt;I never received the promised refund, so I followed up with TC support to obtain it as it was promised. This exchange between myself and Universe can be summarized as follows:
&gt;
&gt;*I asked TC for a refund due to the cancellation and unfulfilled promise for a refund;
&gt;*I was told funds were released to 90sbooze cruise and I had to ask them directly;
&gt;*I attempted to contact EC and received no reply;
&gt;*I provided evidence to TC that EC breached their contract with Universe on multiple grounds and *requested legal action be taken to hold them accountable for what appears to be a scam. This final request received no response from Universe.
&gt;
&gt;**Here is the full exchange** *(copy/paste of full exchange between myself and TC here)*
&gt;
&gt;**(end exchange)**
&gt;
&gt;Now that I have cleared up the apparent lack of communication between departments in your company, I'm sure you understand why I disputed the charge and that I will not be calling my bank. I have already explained to them this situation and they readily agreed to reverse the charge, standard practice when a purchased service has been grossly misrepresented and not rendered. 
&gt;
&gt;So rather than *me* call *my* bank and explain what the charge is for (I know what the charge is for better than you do, apparently), I suggest *you* call 90s booze cruise and explain to them that the contract they signed with *you* has been violated and that they need to issue refunds to **everyone** who asked for one. If they don't, then *you* should contact your lawyer (or acquire one if you do not have one) since your contract has been broken. 

As all evidence points to this ""event"" being a pre-conceived scam, taking the above actions will show that you are not a co-conspirator with 90s booze cruise in what amounts to false marketing and, quite frankly, stealing. Failing to take action (as you did on my last request) shows you are either woefully incompetent, unfortunately apathetic, or outright criminal. 

Please take action as I've outlined above, **and reply to let us (us being myself and all other ticket purchases) when you have done so.**

**Best regards,**
--

[My Name]

**P.S. Can you confirm that the event has been successfully rescheduled for Saturday, July 29th? If so, please send me all relevant event info.**

**P.P.S. To remedy the lack of communication between departments of your company, might I recommend slack messaging?** 

*****

As of now I am awaiting a reply though I expect there will be none. Can anything be done about this? Part of the issue, I believe, is 90s booze cruise is shrouded in mystery. All I have is the e-mail address provided through Universe. I do not know where they are based (I think NY) or have any real contact information, nor, can I connect an actual human to the company. I suspect this is on purpose. It does appear they have advertised this event elsewhere. I am not sure if they followed through with it in these other locations or if it is a systematic scam in multiple locales.

"Neighbor is harassing us, can we get out of the lease? [long post](California). I'm currently in a 1 year lease for an apartment.
It's a multi dwelling apartment, meaning that we have separate entrances, and separate driveways.

However we have an upstairs neighbor, and she has been very nasty to us.

We started to get weird vibes from her from the beginning, like she is nice to us, but only when other people are around. (Like the landlord, her neighbors, or sometimes her friends.)
But when see her and no one else is around, she is cold and curt. Sometimes she would just ignore us.

For example, when we moved in the landlord said to work out parking spots with her. There is our driveway (which is insanely steep), and then a little 2 car lot at street level which is her driveway (she only has 1 car). you can also fit a car parallel to the road next to a power line pole. She said ""yeah it's really whatever, first come first serve. We just kind of figure it out. It's not assigned parking spots"" seemed pretty chill.

Actually on the night before we toured the unit before we knew that we had it, someone had ran into her car which damaged her parking so only 1 car fits there until they fix it, so she got the OK from the neighbor across the street (super kind and generous man.) to park in his dirt lot which can hold like 6-8 cars.

an example of weird vibes is that, before we had finished moving in, my father in law and I were bringing a couch I had bought, we didn't cover it and it started raining right as we got into town. We parked in one of the spots that was supposedly cool to park in, but she got home shortly after and was very impatient with us and was really demanding, asking us how long we are gonna be there cause she has a friend coming over (meanwhile it's raining and the couch I bought is getting wet). so I asked if we should park in the dirt lot, and she loudly said ""NO"".

she had the unit to herself for a few months before we signed our lease, so we are thinking she got used to how things were?

She sent us texts at 4:30pm when we were moving in saying that we were being too loud, and we apologized and explained why the sound was happening to which she replied ""great""

She send us another text, at about 9:40pm on a Saturday night, asking ""do you have carpets yet? maybe that would help..."" this was during my 'bachelor party' (I just had some friends over to play video games before I got married)

Since then she has had many parties (outside on her deck) that go late (11:00pm, 12:00am, 1:00am) on a weeknight, at one point she had a party go until 2:45am on a Friday night, with loud music, stomping (not walking, stomping), and when my wife and I woke up we noticed there were cigarette butts on our deck.. our deck that's covered in dry leaves.

Anyways.. a week or 2 after that, we were almost done unpacking. We had been given a piece of furniture by my sister and we decided to get rid of it by putting it in our driveway (not in the street) with a free sign on it.

we had seen the other neighbors leave stuff out with free signs, like a couch, an aquarium, and a cat jungle gym. There is no HOA here either.

She texted us about it, at which point we texted the landlord asking if what we did was ok, he said it was fine.
So we replied, and explained that we saw the other neighbors do it, and that the landlord said it was ok. but we apologized that it was bothering her and that we would move it when we got home (we were out at dinner).

She replies with a lot of condescension and sarcasm, and claims that she has never seen anyone put furniture out on our street, and that she would never do that ""that's what the dump is for"" and that we need to remember that she lives here too, and that her associates come over.

we decided not to respond to that because it was obviously a lost cause (we suspect she had been drinking because there were a lot of typos). When we got home, the Futon was gone. we thought someone had taken it (it was dark), but when we walked down our driveway we saw that she (presumably) had dragged/pushed it down the driveway. We can't prove it was her. but it would make sense.

there was a huge scrape mark going down the length of the driveway, and the leg of the furniture was bent from being dragged.

we felt like that was an invasion, we didn't feel safe. It was a totally aggressive and dramatic move. not to mention completely unnecessary because we said we would move it. At that point we contacted our landlord to let him know what happened. he said he was unsure of what to do, if he should call her, or wait until his next time coming down (some contractors had done repairs) which he said would be ""in the coming weeks""

we said we would prefer it if he came down so the 4 of us could talk. we didn't want him to call her, because she could just make stuff up. also because she isn't nasty when he's around, we felt like it would help us all reach a amicable solution if he was there as an arbiter.

he said he would come down, but that was more than a month ago.

One night when we were showering, we heard really loud and startling stomping above our heads. We finished our shower and when we got out of the shower we saw that our neighbor had texted my wife using all caps, asking if we just started a load of laundry at 12:00am. - when we do something she doesn't like, she ramps up to 60mph at the drop of a hat, and does something physical.

Based on earlier events, we didn't reply to this text at all. But I emailed my landlord about it.

I didn't feel like we owed it to her to respond to her abusive texts if she's going to be rude and aggressive. and as the days went by we kept showering whenever we wanted to.

She stomped a few more times (at one point even doing like 'marching band' stomping.. it's hard to explain, but doing it with both feet very fast and very loud)

 and at one point she texted my wife again and said that ""she had a meeting early the next morning and our late laundry is disturbing her sleep""

So I (hesitantly) replied on my phone that ""Hello &lt;neighbor&gt;. We actually haven't ever done laundry past 9:00pm, what you're hearing is our shower""

She was sarcastic in her response.. ""so? whatever it is is keeping me up at a very late hour""

This was kind of annoying to us, because she has people over stomping right above our heads several times a month late into the night, and after they leave she is cleaning up moving furniture around slamming it down on her deck.

I've been emailing all of this as it develops to my landlord, he was surprised at her response and expected her to be more laid back (don't really know why.. considering the furniture incident). My landlord said, if she complains again, just tell her that we hear her when her friends are over and lived with it.

A few days later we had to contact him again because our dryer had gone out and we were working on replacing it. He actually said our neighbors dryer went out too (and she left it on the hill outside of our bathroom window...) which angered me because she was harassing us about our furniture but she leaves her dryer outside of our window? I moved it a few feet over because I didn't want to see it, and I didn't want to contact her about it. (then the next day she left a cardboard box to a new samsung phone in the same exact spot...)

He said he has been busy with work and unable to come down, but in the meantime, if we see her, if we bump in to her, then should try to talk to her for a few minutes and just say ""look , we want to work with you. We don't want to be upsetting you with our showers, but when you have friends over late we hear that too and lived with it."". He has been sympathetic to us, but hasn't actually done anything yet. He said that if she is disrespectful again, then he will call her himself, he also said if it was him, he wouldn't want to live here either.

Since her text we had tried to get our showers done earlier (before 11:00pm). Some of the times she has stomped it was when she was clearly awake. We will drive up to our house and see her flipping channels on her TV, we can hear her walking around, calling her cat inside, and on the phone etc... But as soon as we get in the shower she starts stomping. and complains that we are 'waking her up'

So just last week my wife and I shower at 10:30pm, and we hear her start stomping around above us.. I didn't know what to do, so my wife and I wrote a text on my phone but didn't send it, we wanted to sit on it.

We decided, if we saw her the next day, we would try talking to her. But if we didn't we would text her. I felt like I should text her soon because my family was coming over for the long 4th of July weekend, and I didn't want her to be stomping if they needed to shower. (we had a beach day + dinner planned, so I knew we were gonna get back late)

Well we didn't see her, so I texted her Monday July 3rd while we were at dinner saying:

""Good evening neighbour.

I was wondering if you were stomping again during our shower last night? I guess even if you weren't, I wanted to say some things and try to clear the air.

We want to be able to work with you. We don't want to be upsetting you with our showers.
But here's the thing.... when you have your friends over with music playing late at night during the week, we hear that. and we've lived with it.
In May you had people over until almost 3am with really loud stomping and music right above our heads as we were trying to sleep.
I've even heard you take a hammer to your floor at 11:00pm
You woke us up this morning at ~7:40am. with your banging furniture around on your deck right above our bedroom.

Because we live under you, we hear a lot more than you might realize, but we've lived with it.

Live and let live, that's what we've been trying to do.

We've been accommodating and respectful to you. That's all we are asking in return.""

to which she replied:

""I think u need to learn how to live with neighbors.. have you ever lived in a multiple dwelling place before?  There is etiquette involved...and waking people up late (10pm-6am)cause thats when u decided to take a shower is not cool. 

 Having friends over...talking...listening to music at a reasonable hour is cool.  

Leaving your trash / used furniture out on the side of the road with a Free sign on it like you just moved into the ghetto is not cool.

Having friends over ONCE in 3 months late on a Friday night is cool.  

Not communicating concerns you have to your neighbor and instead hitting them with an Uber long text on a monday night....not cool

Having 3 gorgeous decks and wanting to sit outside at 8am is absolutely ok.  It is not my fault you choose to keep non-business hours.
Stop taking showers late (after 10pm) and everything will be okay on my end.  

If my friends stay past 10pm on a weeknight and we are loud...absolutely let me know and we will move it inside.

But if I have friends over 2-3 times a year...late on a Friday or Saturday night....suck it  buttercup.  

 You may want to have people over too...and you know what...i won't say anything 2-3 times a year
And no....you haven't been accommodating and respectful....you have been disdainful and rude.  You didn't even acknowledge me outside one day.. walked right past me.....i smiled said hi....u were completely disrespectful and rude.
I think I have addressed all your concerns.  Have a good night""

After she sent that, I emailed my landlord again.

He replied July 4th in the morning and he said he was frustrated and didn't know what to do. In the 12 years he's owned the place he's never had this problem. He said if we wanted him to, he could call her.

We spent 2 nights at my in laws because being home was too stressful at this point. We were sacred of how she would react when he called her, and we were scared to go home. Even taking a shower at my in laws was stressful. My wife has severe anxiety, and to be honest this situation is giving me a lot of anxiety too.

I emailed my landlord on the 5th, asking if he had called her yet. and he said he hasn't called her because he wanted to enjoy the holiday without any drama.

I haven't heard anything from him since then.

However since then I've looking into taking legal action (trying to get a free consultation from a lawyer here).
I don't know what the landlord is going to do, if anything. or if talking to her is going to help anything at all (or make it worse).

When she dragged our futon around, was that vandalism? Should we have called the police? is it too late to call now?

Is what she's doing defined as harassment? Is that enough for us to get out of a lease? Is there any other legal action we can take?

We are scared to bump into her.. and she is always on her wrap around deck above us which means if we use our deck we would have to see her.

Rent isn't cheap in California, and if my landlord isn't gonna do anything I don't see why I need to pay thousands more dollars to be living under a bully with this stress. We have family willing to take us in until we find a new place.

We are very skeptical that he will evict her.",1
