      <p>Despite what I said above, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/571acb59e707ebff3074f461/t/5cfe69e4a851d80001bdf162/1560177127345/Substantive+Legal+Software+Quality+-+A+Gathering+Storm.pdf" target="_bkank">Substantive Legal Software Quality—A Gathering Storm?</a> isn't part of this level's reading. I've decided to move it to Level 3.</p>

      <p>Also, I've tried to refine my description of the <i>As You Like It Method</i>, described in the video above. I decided to take the name from Shakespeare's <i>As You Like It</i> from which we get the quote, "All the world's a stage."</p>

      <h3 style="margin-top:10px">All the World's a Stage: How To Achieve Almost Any Goal in Three Easy Steps<sup>0</sup><a href="#goals" name="goals" class="anchor"></a></h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Craft a believable story, set in the present, that ends with The Goal being achieved.<sup>1</sup></li>
        <li>Break this story into scenes, and have those on Team Goal do their best to act out the first scene.<sup>2</sup></li>
        <li>After reality deviates from the script, the scene ends, or the passage of some fixed amount of time, repeat these steps until either: The Goal is met; or it becomes impossible to craft a believable story.<sup>3</sup></li>
      </ol>

      <p><sup>0</sup> These rules began its life as a playbook for students working as part of the LIT Lab’s consultancy practice. Originally, I was shooting for something like the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/" target="_blank">Digital Services Playbook</a>. Unfortunately, my early drafts relied too much on nomenclature and industry norms unfamiliar to the average law student. I considered zooming in (providing context and explanation for every reference), but that seemed like a recipe for infinite regress. So I opted to zoom out and focus on general principles. This has freed me to use specific examples for illustrative purposes without the need for them to be all encompassing. It also allows me to highlight similarities between multiple systems for getting things done. To avoid the trap of just telling folks to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl?full=1" target="_blank">draw the Owl</a>, I’m providing some context for each of the steps through footnotes and appendices. Yes, this is a bit of a gimmick, and the title above is total click bait. There are only three steps, but it takes thousands of words to imbue them with meaning. It’s worth noting, however, that this is the case for many endeavors. Jargon gets a bad rap, and deservedly so when used to obscure meaning, but a good term of art or framing mechanism, once understood, can stand in for paragraphs of exposition. With the creation of such building blocks, discussion and reasoning can move more quickly. This is especially true for collaborations, where a reliable shorthand eases communication. Consider that the job of every prosecutor in a criminal trial can be boiled down to ten words: prove the elements of the crime(s) beyond a reasonable doubt. Those ten words are a good guide to action. Zoom out more, and you can describe a prosecutor’s whole job in two words: do justice. Such drastic distillation comes with benefits and risks. Done well it can provide clarity and direction. Over do it and you’re left with pablum. Worse yet is the space between, where clarity is an illusion, everyone relying on a sui generis interpretation, secure in the belief their understanding is shared by all. That being said, let’s see if we can arrive at a common understanding.
      </p><p>
      <sup>1</sup><i>Believable</i> is doing a lot of work in this sentence. Here, it’s roughly synonymous with realistic or probable. In order to tell such a story, you have to truly understand your “characters” and their “motivations.” Sometimes you’re lucky, and your characters aren’t people. This is where the hard sciences shine. If asked to tell a story about how to place a satellite in geosynchronous orbit, the primary players (i.e., the satellite and the Earth) find themselves constrained by a set of well-understood physical laws. To achieve geosynchronous orbit we have to get the satellite to a specific distance above the Earth traveling with some set horizontal velocity. That’s it. This is an engineering problem because the story we’re asked to craft ends with an easily-stated objectively-measurable goal, the achievement of which relies on what you might call well-understood “motivations” (physical laws). Once your story includes considerations like how to pay for things, source materials, motivate employees, and clear political hurdles, its nature becomes much more speculative. No longer can the story be told by equations alone. <b>We are speaking of storytelling as simulation. That is, in order to tell a believable story, we construct a series of probable events that result in the desired outcome based on our understanding of how the world works.</b> The scope of our story and the understanding needed to craft it depend greatly on the goal(s) we seek to achieve. So to do this step well, we have to know what we want and enough about the world to tell a story that moves us from the world as it is to the world we want it to be.
      </p><p>
      Our initial story is unlikely to survive engagement with reality. So it’s important that we’re able to recognize success and change course when we fall short. Consequently, our goals must be measurable. For example, it’s not enough to say that we want to build or do a great thing. We have to define what we would see if we were to build or do a great thing. This doesn’t have to be an objective measure per se. Subjectivity is fine. If by “a great thing” we mean “Sally thinks it’s great,” or “demographic X thinks it’s great,” we can work with that. We just need to identify a measurable success metric. So our metric might be, “Does Sally say she thinks it’s great?” Admittedly, some goals are harder to measure than others, and there is a temptation to redefine our goals to correspond with easily measured metrics. Fight that temptation. Your goals are a reflection of your values, and you shouldn’t compromise them because something is hard (unless you value them less than the required effort). Pragmatism is productive, but it’s not an excuse to be lazy.
      <p>
      <sup>2</sup> As you can see from step three, the end of a scene is notable for the fact that it can trigger the creation of a new story. <b>So scenes act as built-in checkpoints.</b> Like the story’s ultimate Goal, they should come with measurable conclusions, but <b>their completion should also tell us something about our overall progress</b>, so we know if we’re moving in the right direction. If your goal is product development, this is comparable to focusing on a Minimum Viable Product per scene, what some might call iterative prototyping.
      </p><p>
      As for Team Goal, this is just the collection of folks working to achieve The Goal. Your team may be a formal working group or just a collection of folks with common cause. Heck, it may be a team of one. What’s important for our purpose is that the team members are willing to work together and live out their parts in the story. Consequently, it has to be a shared story (one all the members buy into). One of the best ways to make this happen is to have the team contribute to the story’s creation. After all, if they’ll be the ones acting it out, they’re likely to have some suggestions. This of course is just a reflection of what I find to be a believable story. I clearly think that giving folks agency over a story is motivating. Maybe I’m right; maybe I’m wrong. Either way, it’s stories all the way down.
      <p>
      <sup>3</sup> The important point here is that there be some regular reassessment. If things go off the rails the need for such will be clear, but you need to build in structures that mandate periodic evaluations. As discussed in footnote 2, scenes provide convenient opportunities for such. Setting a fixed time to check in can act as a fail safe should a chapter take longer than expected to run its course. Whatever the triggering event, step three is the point at which your past work becomes prologue for a new story. If you’re lucky, you can just re-number the scenes from a prior version, advancing one chapter closer to your goal. If you’re really lucky, you’ll find that you’ve reached your goal. More likely, however, you’ll have to make a few adjustments based on what went wrong and what worked well, and occasionally, you’ll discover that there just isn’t a believable story to tell.

      <div class="caption">Maps are models, and they don't show everything. That's okay.</div>
    </div>
    <p><b>So What?</b> These steps probably sound familiar. They come in many incarnations and clearly belong to a family of iterative processes like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method" target="_blank">scientific method</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking" target="_blank">design thinking</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" target="_blank">Agile software development</a>. It’s also easy to see in them reflections of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics" target="_blank">cybernetics</a> and Hosfteter’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop" target="_blank">strange loops</a>. There is nothing more central to the human experience than telling stories. Over the semester, we’ll discuss methodologies like Agile, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)" target="_blank">Kanban</a>, design thinking, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" target="_blank">GTD</a> and the like because you’ll find their followers and evangelists out in the wild. You may be tempted to ask, “which one is right?” but that’s probably the wrong question. In my experience, any structured method for getting things done is often better than no method. These methods embody mental models that try to describe the world (believable stories), and as George Box observed, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” So remember that since they’re “wrong” they should start, not end, conversation. Avoid dogma. Second, to know whether or not a model is useful, you have to ask “compared to what?” Models do not exist in isolation. Their adoption will replace something. Again, structure often beats its absence. Maps are models of the world. They don’t show every inch of the territory they describe. So they’re “wrong,” but this doesn’t mean they aren’t useful. Context matters.
    </p><p>
      <b>When you boil the sum of productivity hacks and management advice down to their essence, they’re all about capturing your goals, crafting believable stories to guide action, testing these stories against reality, and refining them over time.</b> With this in mind, you can better evaluate all that friendly advice. Just ask yourself what it contributes to crafting better shared stories and helping folks stick to the script. If the process includes the word “innovation” or “design” it’s probably concerned with telling better stories, if it’s talking about “productivity” or “efficiency” it’s often about helping folks stick to the script (usually by telling a story that helps guide action). Either way, this advice holds, “do what works.”

        <p>I realize I didn't actually tell you how the story ended. Never fear, the court saw the error of their ways and started following the rules.

      <p>Everyone comes to this adventure with a different background. So this section is designed to be a menu of sorts. If you already know a topic well, you can skip the relevant material. Just answer the questions below, and section(s) will disappear accordingly. That being said, if a section doesn't disappear, you should do it. Any time you save skipping a topic, however, should be spent working on your final project or reading ahead in either <i>Weapons of Math Destruction</i> or <i>How Not to Be Wrong</i>. FYI, we will be reading all of <i>Weapons of Math Destruction</i> and all but parts III and V of <i>How Not to Be Wrong</i>.</p>

      <p>All of that being said, let's see if we can pare things down.</p>

        <span class="subtitle"> ~1.8 hours | September 12, 2021 @ 4pm Eastern</span></h2>

      <p>If you're an enrolled student, we'll be meeting in Sargent Hall Room 325 on Monday September 12th at 4pm. If you're not an enrolled student, I'm afraid you can't join us.</p>

      <p>We will use this time to: (1) troubleshoot any issues folks might have had working through the <a href="#knowledge">knowledge base</a>; (2) start work on <a href="#mission_p2">the second part of your mission</a>; and (3) discuss the readings.</p>

      <p><b>Stretch Goal:</b> Split your QnA and any JavaScript function(s) into separate files, with the QnA referencing a .js file (e.g., including the following in your “Before” tag <code>&lt;script src="https://[your username].github.io/ctl/functions.js">&lt;/script></code>). This allows for the sharing of a single set of functions across different QnAs. So if they need to change (like when the guidelines get updated), there’s only one place to make that change. See <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_script_src.asp" target="_blank">HTML &lt;script> src Attribute</a>.</p>
