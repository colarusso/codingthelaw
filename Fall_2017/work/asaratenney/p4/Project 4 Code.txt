Q(all):All children in Massachusetts should be tested for lead. These tests may either be administered by a physician or at a local health clinic. Parents can also contact the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program at (800) 532-9571. GOTO:apt

Q(apt):Are you currently living in an apartment or rental unit?
A:Yes
	Q(4.1):Was your building likely built before 1978?
	A:Yes
		Q(4.1.1):Has your landlord supplied you with the following documentation prior to the start of your lease?
		<center><br>Information about possible lead paint on the property<br>
		<br>Lead Law Notification and Certification forms</br>
		<br>A copy of the most recent lead inspection report, if there is one</br>
		<br>A copy of a letter of compliance, if the property was deleaded</br></center>
		A:Yes
			Q(4.1.1.1):Congrats, your landlord has met the documentation requirements in the state of Massachusetts. 
		A:No
			Q(4.1.1.2):Have you asked your landlord in writing for a lead inspection?
			A:Yes, and my landlord agreed to have the apartment inspected
				Q(4.1.1.2.1): Great! After the lead inspection is complete you have a right to know the results. You may have to move out during deleading. Your landlord must pay reasonable moving expenses, anywhere you go. If you stay with family or friends during deleading, you do not have to pay rent.  If your landlord finds you temporary housing, keep paying your landlord your usual rent. If the temporary housing is more expensive than your regular rent, it is your landlord’s responsibility to take care of it. All of this information is easily accessible online <a href="http://www.masslegalhelp.org/housing/private-housing/ch9-lead-poisoning"target="_blank">here.</a> You may also want to discuss your circumstances with an attorney.
			A:Yes, but my landlord declined to my apartment inspected for lead.
				Q(4.1.1.2.2): Make sure your request is in writing. If a child under 6 years old lives in the home and the landlord does not schedule a licensed lead inspector to inspect the tenant may either: 
				<center><br>1. Ask your local Board of Health or the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program for a free lead inspection.</br> 
				<br>2. Do the testing themselves with a home lead test kit. These can be purchased online or at a hardware store.</br> 
				<br>3. Hire a licensed lead inspector. If the inspector finds lead, the landlord must pay you back for the inspection.</br>  
 				<br>The landlord must remove or cover any dangerous levels of lead that are found.  If they refuse to do this, a tenant should contact a local attorney.</br>  

				<br>Do you feel as though your landlord has retaliated against you for reporting a violation of the law?</br>
				A:Yes
					Q(4.1.1.2.2.1):See Massachusetts General Law 186 s. 18 <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleI/Chapter186/Section18"target="_blank">Massachusetts General Law 186 s. 18.</a> Reprisals Against Tenants for Reporting violations. MGL 186 s. 18 prohibits threats and acts of reprisal against a tenant who reports a violation of law or commences a judicial or administrative proceeding against the property owner.  The landlord may not terminate tenancy, increase rent, or substantially alter the terms of the lease within a 6 month time frame, otherwise a presumption is created that the property owner must rebut with clear and convincing evidence there was no reprisal.
				A:No
					Q(4.1.1.2.2.2):Have a nice day
			A:No, because I don’t know what to say to my landlord.
