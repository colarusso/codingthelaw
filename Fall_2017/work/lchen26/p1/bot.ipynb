    "# Assigned Counsel and Fee Waiver Bot\n",
    "By lchen26 \n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote a bot, and you can find it [here](http://www.codingthelaw.org/Fall_2017/work/lchen26/p1/bot.html). To write my bot, we used a tool called [QnA Markup](http://www.qnamarkup.org/). Basically, you create an interactive decision tree by nesting questions and answers. Here's [my code](http://www.codingthelaw.org/Fall_2017/work/lchen26/p1/bot.txt). \n",
    "\n",
    "## User Testing\n",
    "In This process, I did peer testing with my partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "To refine this, I did research into the relevant laws. The two codes are § 17.1-606 and § 19.2-159. \n",
    "\n",
    "17.1-606 defines the fee waiver process in civil cases.\n",
    "19.2-159 defines the appointment of counsel in criminal cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Viability\n",
    "\n",
    "I am continuing to work on adapting based on feedback. To make it more viable, I would have a more robust set of values to be filled."
