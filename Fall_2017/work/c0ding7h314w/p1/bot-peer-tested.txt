Consequently, you may be eligible to have your court fees waived. Please note that if you are a minor, the affidavit must be filled out by another person having knowledge of the facts.  See <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=073500050K5-105" target=_new>735 ILCS 5/5-105(c)</a>.  Would you like me to open up a fee waiver for you to file?
