Q(1): Hello! My name is CLAIRA, and I will be helping you understand whether you are eligible for a court-appointed lawyer or other fee waivers (also known as your indigent status). Before we start, please note that several pieces of financial information may be required during this process, including your gross weekly income, total living expenses, and total liquid assets. These terms will be defined for you as they are required, but you will want to have all your financial data handy in order to answer questions as they arise. Now let\'92s begin.GOTO:first\
\
Q(first): Are you involved in a civil or a criminal case?\
A: What is the difference between a civil and a criminal case?\
	Q(2.1): In a criminal case, the Federal or State government is charging you with a crime. For a civil case, another private citizen is accusing you of wronging them in some way (or you are doing the accusing).GOTO:first\
A: Criminal\
	Q(2.2):GOTO:second\
A: Civil\
	Q(2.3): Thank you. For civil cases you will not be appointed a lawyer by the court, but you may be able to pay fewer or none of the fees usually required to file paperwork during the course of a legal proceeding. These fees can be required when asking the court to do something (e.g. filing a motion) or even to begin the process of filing a claim against another party.GOTO:pova\
\
Q(pova): To get these fees waived you will need to file a poverty affidavit. Would you like to do that now?\
A: Tell me more about this poverty affidavit.\
	Q(3.1): A poverty affidavit is your sworn statement that your income is too low to afford paying the fees. In this affidavit you will need to list your income, assets, and some other personal information. There is no strict income cutoff above which your fees will not be waived; rather the court will use the information in the affidavit to decide whether you are able to pay. You will also need to get the affidavit notarized. After completing this form, simply give it to the clerk at the court where your case is being heard.GOTO:pova\
A: Yes, I'd like help filing out the affidavit.\
	Q(3.2): Great. I will now ask you a series of questions to fully populate the form. However, if you don't know a particular piece of information right now, we'll just leave that field blank and you can fill it in after printing.GOTO:name\
A: Yes, but just give me the blank form. I can fill it out myself.\

	Q(19.1):GOTO:signoff\
\
Q(que2): It looks like you qualify for a court-appointed lawyer! However, since your net income (annual gross income minus basic living expenses) exceeds 125% of the federal poverty level, you may be required to repay some of the costs for services provided to you. I will now import any information you provided into the required Financial Disclosure & Affidavit of Indigency Form. Please follow this link to complete and print your affidavit:\
A: 'insert form link'\
	Q(20.1):GOTO:signoff\
\
Q(notque): Unfortunately, I have determined that you do not qualify for a court-appointed lawyer at this time. However, a judge may still choose to appoint you counsel if the number, complexity, and seriousness of your charges warrant it or you have tried but are unable to employ qualified counsel, but only the judge can make that determination. Further, if new information becomes known or if your financial circumstances change such that you might qualify later as indigent, you could be eligible for counsel at that later date. Even if you do not qualify as indigent, you may still be eligible to receive assistance in order to pay for experts, transcripts, and other related legal expenses if you do not have sufficient funds to pay for them. Again, the judge will have to make this determination.GOTO:signoff\
