    "# Project Three Notebook\n",
    "By [Erica Dumore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erica-dumore-62b306a2/) \n",

    "## Is this restaurant up to code?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project takes generated data from [data.gov](data.gov) that evaluated different restaurants located throughout San Francisco, California and reported their health inspection spore. The city released this data publically, reporting the name of a restaurant, the date of the inspection, the reason for the inspection, the inspection score it received, a description if a violation was found, and the risk category the restaurant was placed in as a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on specific categories, inspection score and inspection type, found within [this csv file](restaurant.csv) which can be downloaded from this [link](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/food-inspections-lives-standard), to predict whether our target, the inspection scores, can be predicted by our features, the different types of inspections being preformed. Through the use of a linear regression graph, we will see what correlation exists between our target and our features. Based on the pattern generated, we will be able to predict whether an inspection score does correlate with the type of inspection being preformed, allowing the investigator to have an idea prior to preforming the inspection, what they can expect to see. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea being that a new ownership inspection may often result in a high inspection score with low risk, verse a foodborne illness investigation may result in a low inspection score with high risk. Or a scheduled, verse an unscheduled inspection, may influence the outcome of the inspection score and risk category. These were a few of my hypotheses at the outset of this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Process\n",
    "\n",
    "This project took a lot of trial and error. The first step was deciding what my target and features were going to be. I knew I wanted the inspection scores to be my target, but deciding what would be my features was a more difficult task. Ultimately I decided to use the different types of inspections being performed. This was because I needed a feature that was going to be predictory, something that could be used repetitively based off of one factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "After I had decided my target and my feature I created my first set of code. The first time I created my code I mistakenly generated a cell for each individual linear graph for each different type of inspection performed. Although these graphs were accurate and did provide me with some feedback, they were too specific and did not provide me with an overall view of how all the different types of inspections correlated together in terms of what range they fell into for inspection scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, under the heading Data Cleaning, please find an explanation of how I rewrote my code to solve the above mentioned problem, utilizing dummy variables to add all of the different types of inspections onto my data spreadsheet to generate number responses, making it even easier to graph. "
