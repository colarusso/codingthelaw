"What Is The Legality Of The Possession/Distribution Of Nitrous Oxide (Big Ass Tanks) In Louisiana/Colorado?. The Title says it all. I know I could find this info by doing some digging, but I'm extremely lazy. A friend of mine wants to know for whatever reason. he lives in Colorado but goes to school here with me in Louisiana.

"Is it necessary for a cop to issue someone a ticket, just to prove that the other driver was not at fault?. I was involved in an at-fault accident recently.  This is my first accident, and hopefully my last.  The cop told me he needs to prove to the insurance company that it was not the other guy's fault.  He wrote me a ticket for failing to maintain a safe distance.  Couldn't he have acknowledged that this was not the other driver's fault in a police report, but not issue me a ticket?",0
"Is Collusion with another country during an election actually illegal?. I'm very confused at the moment. Hedged my bets on there not being any evidence of collusion but now it's been unceremoniously discovered, is it even illegal? I don't think it's a big deal tbh. Some journalists tried to release it before me, but I decided to post it before them on a well known social network. Shows I'm a straight-shooter, I'm guessing this is legally sound?

""3. He or she engages in a course of conduct or repeatedly commits acts which alarm or seriously annoy such other person and which serve no legitimate purpose.""

They mentioned 145 of that is a conveyance fee that will just have to exist. I am curious if there is a reliable way I can do this myself or if that 155 extra is worth it. Or if anyone knows someone who can reliably do it for cheaper that'd be awesome.
